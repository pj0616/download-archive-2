# Git

I love Git and version control. And I use version control over any project I do. I follow a [series of rules](../focusing/rules.md#git) when dealing with Git.

## Notes

- Commit as often as you can. Ideally after each micro-iteration, when something new is working.
  - This way, at the end of the day you can just rebase the whole branch and squash all of the micro-commits in a whole commit implementing the whole new features.
- Good git workflow to make changes to new projects: clone, fork (`hub fork`), 'git checkout -b my-feature', work, commit, 'git push -u nikitavoloboev my-feature', work, commit, 'git push'.
- If you’re doing things right, there’s only two kinds of branches anyways, master and feature branches. Feature branches can be squashed and rebased off master (minimizing the issue of merge conflicts and making for easier management of the commit history) and merged to master from there without requiring further conflict resolution. ([Trunk-Based Development](https://paulhammant.com/2013/04/05/what-is-trunk-based-development/))
- A Git branch is just a pointer to a commit. Git commits, however, also contain the hash of the parent commit(s), so by referring to that commit you also refer too all ancestors.
- Squash + rebase (for feature branches) are good for PRs. No one cares that it took you 20 tries to get the feature right, what matters is what went into the pull request, which is usually one commit.
- [To me the beauty of git stems from the fact that it is an implementation of a functional data structure. It‘s a tree index that is read-only, and updating it involves creating a complete copy of the tree and giving it a new name. Then the only challenge is to make that copy as cheap as possible - for which the tree lends itself, as only the nodes on the path to the root need to get updated. As a result, you get lock-free transactions (branches) and minimal overhead. It is so beautiful in fact that when I think about systems that need to maintain long-running state in concurrent environments, my first reaction is ”split up the state into files, and maintain it through git“.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21418033)
