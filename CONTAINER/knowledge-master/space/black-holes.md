# Black holes

## Notes

- [It means all of the predictions we have made about black holes appear to be correct - we never could have said that definitively without an actual image. It means that predictions about how gravity works at this scale are apparently correct. It means we can image things, successfully with a telescope the size of the planet. It means black holes are no longer science fiction, aren't just predictions or expectations but definitely there. It means that general relativity doesn't change even at scales as huge as a super massive black hole. It means that our predictions of it's mass made from observing stellar orbits were pretty much right on.](https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/bblt4f/astronomers_capture_first_image_of_a_black_hole/)
