# Blogs

I use [Reeder](http://reederapp.com/mac/) to stay on top of my favorite blogs I follow which I sync with [Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com) between phone and mac.

I separate blogs I follow by quality into `1.` & `2.` folders accordingly.

I share my [XML subscription feed of blogs I follow](https://gist.github.com/nikitavoloboev/f67d6d37a8c32fa6f86a23bd77107fbd). I also follow some people on [Medium](https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev/following).

## Favorite blogs

Full list can be seen in [XML feed of subscriptions under 1. folder](https://gist.github.com/nikitavoloboev/f67d6d37a8c32fa6f86a23bd77107fbd#file-my-inoreader-subscriptions-xml-L7).
