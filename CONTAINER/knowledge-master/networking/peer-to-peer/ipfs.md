# [IPFS](https://ipfs.io)

Is [interesting](https://blog.neocities.org/blog/2015/09/08/its-time-for-the-distributed-web.html).

I especially like the distinction of distributing content over distributing links. Each piece of content being represented by a unique hash.

## Notes

- HTTP isn't the reason things are centralizing so much as economies of scale and convenience are.
