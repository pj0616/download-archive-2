# macOS

macOS is my [favorite desktop operating system](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os#readme).

I do wish to expand my horizons and try out Linux more. I doubt I will ever be able to move to another operating system as I have too much invested in optimizing and using macOS but I do want to take the best of all worlds. Linux is open source, has an increasingly large community of users and developers and one thing that I love about UNIX systems is that by using these systems you effectively become a developer. Because otherwise you are simply missing out on the _full experience_.

## Clean install

You can clean install by going to Recovery mode (restart with `cmd+r` pressed). Then Disk Utility > Select disk > Erase (Format it) > Close Disk Utility > Select option Reinstall MacOS (Choose macOS ver. to install).

## Notes

- In save dialogues I can press these keys:
  - `Return` or `⌘ + S` = Save
  - `ESC` = Cancel
- I can also press `/` or `~` to quickly go to some directory from a save dialogue. And I can press `⌘ + ↑` to go to `parent directory`.
- Recovery mode: Power off the machine, press the power button and immediately hold Cmd-R.
- [Both Windows and MacOS are at a point where clean installs are unnecessary.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/90g4h9/is_it_worth_the_effort_to_do_a_clean_install_of/)
  - I can appreciate someone wanting to do a clean install if they've installed and removed many apps and just want to clear out everything spread around all the system and hidden folders, even if it doesn't really affect performance and won't save a ton of disk space. There is something cathartic about a clean install.
- `/usr/local/bin` is a good place to put raw binaries available in the path, that are not installed with Nix.
