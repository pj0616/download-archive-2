# [MindNode](https://mindnode.com/)

An application which allowed me to originally create [all of the maps](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/df7lxpsizx0ukd7/AAAUZzX55vnfZMqTRuhzJbWwa?dl=0) for [Learn Anything](https://learn-anything.xyz).

I also use MindNode to [visually break down problems I am trying to solve](../../research/solving-problems.md).

And I visualize topics and their relations as an [interactive mind map](https://my.mindnode.com/dPmKpWZgTpZsaG4Rf1yaz7rXbYhnuqPDDpdss4w2#1594.8,-1084.6,1). I use [Monokai Night](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os/tree/master/mindnode#readme) theme for it.
