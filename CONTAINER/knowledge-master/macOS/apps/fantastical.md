# [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical)

I use the app to manage events in my life I sync with Google Calendar.

I use Fantastical's natural language input together with [many Typinator expansions](https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev/fantastical-natural-input-text-expansions-3ea8cf7ccac3#.pv5937ncr) to make new events in seconds.

I always view my events from `Week` view & have 5 days in view only with 16 hours shown only (7:00 -> 23:00). This gives me perspective over current and upcoming events/deadlines.

I use `All day events` as a way to [put a focus on a project for a particular day](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev/status/1136715942338224128) based on [my goals](../../focusing/focusing.md). With the focus in mind, planning events becomes easier.

I often switch between `Week` view and `Month`. And I have [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com) calendar added to Fantastical too as separate account.

## Notes

- To mass delete events, make empty search query (single space) on events I want to remove and delete them. Can also use stock Calendar app and search for `""` and cmd+shift+arrows events I want to delete.
- [Google calendar sync select page](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/syncselect) allows you to select which calendars you want to sync to external apps like Fantastical. Useful for letting Fantastical know about `Other calendars` which by default don't sync.
