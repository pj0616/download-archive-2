# Foods

I eat a whole food, plant based diet and experiment by trying out new [vegan recipes](recipes.md). I exclude all unhealthy food.

Most of my diet consists of eating raw foods like various nuts (almonds, walnuts), blueberries, bananas and avocados.

I try to cover my micro & macro nutrient needs by consuming the most nutritious food I can. Sometimes I make a smoothie of different superfoods to kickstart my day.

- Blueberries (200g+)
- Broccoli / Kale (50g+)
- Walnuts / Almonds (100g+)

I [supplement](supplements.md) nutrients I am missing out on.

I use [Paprika app](https://www.paprikaapp.com/) to store all my recipes & the foods I can eat sorted into categories (with top first). Here is how it looks:
