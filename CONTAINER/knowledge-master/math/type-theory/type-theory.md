# [Type Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory)

## Notes

- A value is some concrete thing, and a type is a collection of concrete things (but is itself not a concrete thing. For example any individual integer is a value, but the collection of all integers is a type. Much like elements and sets in set theory.
- A type is a collection of values which inhabit that type. A type is a value which is a member of the type of types.
- Type theory goes much much further than just tagging data.
- The type determines which data structure you use.
- Dependent types is basically about being able to express arbitrary things in your type system, meaning that you can construct arbitrary proofs. That's how Coq, Agda and Idris work.
- Types are types and propositions are propositions; types come from programming languages, and propositions from logic, and they seem to have no relation to each other.
- [Types are specifications of behavior.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LE0SSLizYUI)
- Roughly speaking, a [type is a specification of its possible values](https://github.com/skaslev/why-types/blob/master/why-types.pdf).
