## Notes

- ID's are unique.
  - Each element can have only one ID.
  - Each page can have only one element with that ID.
- Classes are NOT unique.
  - You can use the same class on multiple elements.
  - You can use multiple classes on the same element.
- [The DOM is just a tree of objects. CSS selects parts of that tree and applies attributes to those objects. It's all just code, it's just a shorthand for adding a bunch of attributes to a bunch of objects.](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/9jpvon/do_you_even_need_a_css_framework/)
- [Always design your CSS format from the inside out](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-way-to-prevent-divs-from-overlapping-I-have-3-divs-The-First-div-changes-its-size-and-overlaps-the-second-one-which-is-a-set-of-images)
  - format the elements within their container so that they look correct regardless of the size of the container.
  - similarly format those containers within their own containers
  - repeat until `<body>` is the containers
  - never use absolute widths (px, in, cm, etc.) for anything
- body tag takes up the whole width and height of the browser screen.
