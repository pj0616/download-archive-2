# Success

Success comes from not giving up and doing what you love.

## Notes

- Figure out what you are uniquely the best in the world at because you just love it. And then just find out who or what needs that the most.
- Doing what everybody else is doing feels like the safest thing to do. But it’s also the most competitive, which makes it the riskiest.
- If you’re good at course correcting, being wrong may be less costly than you think, whereas being slow is going to be expensive for sure.
- The trick with being confident, is accepting the results of an action or situation before it even happens.
