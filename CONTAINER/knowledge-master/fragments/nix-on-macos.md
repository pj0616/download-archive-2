# Nix on macOS

- What is nix?
- Nix over brew. Purity, dev experience.
- Install nix

I've been using homebrew as my package manager for macOS for over 3 years now and it has served me well over that time. Most anything I wanted to install was one `brew install` away.

Despite all of that, I recently stumbled upon an interesting project that tries to solve the problem of package management fundamentally. It does this by creating a new package manager called [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/).
