# Markdown

Markdown is amazing and such an awesome way to format the text you write. I am using most of the features from it where appropriate.

## Notes

- You can use relative paths in markdown links.
- Don't add extra space after heading as it is unnecessary.
- In referencing titles to jump to in readme, lowercase them. **i.e. `[Contributing](#contributing)`**. Lose the punctuation in the end in the link.
- Can use `<details>` & `<summary>` to make readmes more readable & hiding info behind a clickable dropdown. ([Good example](https://github.com/amejiarosario/dsa.js-data-structures-algorithms-javascript#readme))
