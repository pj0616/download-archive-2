# Drugs

Our body likes to stay and keep itself in a state of homeostasis. I think it is best not to mess with this state too much. Or if one does, one should leave enough time for the body to come back to normal.

Moderation is key with drugs of any kind, be it medicine or recreational use. Knowing what the appropriate dosage is, what effects a drug has and what are the consequences of taking the drug is of utmost importance.
