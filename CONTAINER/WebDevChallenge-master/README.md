# Code-Challenge-WEB
This is the code challenge for anyone interested in being a Web Developer at Igloo.

## Scenario
A non-developer co-worker has attempted to implement a design in haste and while they have basic knowledge of HTML and CSS, they quickly run into trouble trying to finish the task. As a web developer, you need to complete the design based on the provided PSD while cleaning up the existing code.

## Instructions
1. Clone this repo to your local development environment
2. Refer to the design mock-ups while developing the home page [Design Assets](https://github.com/IglooSoftware/Code-Challenge-WEB-Members/tree/master/assets)
3. Start your work in the index.html file
4. Bind an event to the *load more* button within `js/main.js` to trigger an API call that will retrieve and display the next collection of members from the mock API service provided by [Randomuser.me](https://randomuser.me). Page size should be 5 and ajax calls should leverage the provided apiClient loaded from `js/apiClient.js`.

Remember: In implementing a design, attention to detail is key (*container sizes, positioning, fonts, etc.*)

You can use libraries but in your submission, you must include the reasoning for using the libraries.

You can make assumptions in your submission as well but the assumptions must be documented in your submission as well as the reason that assumption was made and what that affected.
