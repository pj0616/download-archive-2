React Github Notetaker
=======================

Because React is only 'the V in MVC', in order to get a React app up and running you need to actually know more than just React. This repo accompanies a future blog post on writing a React app with Flux, Browserify, Firebase, React-Router, and Gulp. The app we're going to build is going to allow users to connect to someones github account then take notes on that person (say for a job interview).
