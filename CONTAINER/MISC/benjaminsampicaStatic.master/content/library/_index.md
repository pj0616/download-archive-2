There's something about owning a physical copy of a book that I've always adored and have never gotten into the digital book thing.

If you're looking for something new to read, whether it be programming, agile, communication, DevOps, mathematics, or design, a list of all the books I own is below and hopefully one or more will interest you (and you'll catch a reading bug :) ). No affiliate links are attached to any of these - I benefit in no way shape or form from you buying or purchasing anything.

I tend to favor soft-skill books over direct technology books simply because they're valuable for longer periods of time (hopefully a lifetime even!).
