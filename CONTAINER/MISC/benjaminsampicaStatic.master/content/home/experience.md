I am ﬁrst a full-stack developer starting with gathering requirements/existing workﬂows through front-end implementation with client acceptance.

On top of this I maintain the CI/CD functionality on our Azure DevOps organization and maintain a 'Pipelines' repository with our YAML ﬁles, which houses our different strategies for building, testing, and deploying our applications automatically.

I created and led an API strategy for sun setting legacy applications that needed to continue to speak with each other. These were coupled with a few ASP.NET Core websites that were to replace legacy applications.

To deploy these applications, I utilized Azure DevOps for CI/CD for pull requests, merges, and deployment. 

I also largely maintained and refactored legacy applications written in VB.NET, VBScript, and other more long-in-thetooth languages.
Finally, I wrote a base web application for Casey's IT to jump start new development initiatives.
