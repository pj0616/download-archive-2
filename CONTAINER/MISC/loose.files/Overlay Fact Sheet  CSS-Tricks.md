Take the pain out of building site search with the Algolia hosted API. **[Start free now!](https://srv.buysellads.com/ads/long/x/T6A3N7DTTTTTTT66YJJCTTTTTTTVXPSDKTTTTTTTL4MCVYTTTTTTTR7M5VBNBBPUCMZDVIPYC73H6KZZP3ACOW44VQPE)**

I would hope all our web designer/developer spidey senses trigger when the solution to an accessibility problem isn’t “fix the issue” but rather “add extra stuff to the page.” This [Overlay Fact Sheet](https://overlayfactsheet.com/) website explains that. An “Overlay” is one of those “add extra stuff to the page” things, ostensibly for improving accessibility. Except, even though marketing may suggest they are a silver bullet to accessibility, they are… not.

The site does a much better job laying that out than I can, so go check it out. As I write, it’s signed by 352 people, mostly people who are accessibility professionals.
