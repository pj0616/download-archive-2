# Client Side Routing - HTTP - Atomic Design

## Topics
  * Routing with React Router
  * Axios for making HTTP requests
  * JavaScript Promises
  * Atomic Design

## Description
In this `create-react-app` initialized app, you will be working with the provided UI library, which has been developed based on `Atomic Design` principles. This is not the only way to design and organize your components, but it will serve as an example of a very strong option.

The app you will be finishing is an app that lists a few dog breeds, shows an image, and provides links to view their sub-breeds.

## Instructions
You are given the `atoms`, `molecules`, `organisms`, and `templates` needed to build out this app. You will just need to consume them in your pages `Breeds.js` and `SubBreeds.js`. All of your HTTP requests should be made from inside of the page files.

* Requirements for `Breeds.js`
  * Title should be "Breeds"
  * Show a list of dog breeds
  * Each list item should be a link to a `SubBreed` page that shows the sub-breed details
  * Show an image of the first dog breed in the list, with that breed as a title for the image
  * use the provided method `filterBreeds` or any modification of it to limit the list (This is to make sure that the breeds we show actually have sub-breeds. Make sure you still make the initial get requests for the list of dogs first though as part of the assignment exercise)

* Requirements for `SubBreeds.js`
  * Title should be "Sub-breeds"
  * Subtitle should be the given breed
  * Show a list of sub-breeds for the given breed
  * Show an image of the first sub-breed in the list, with that sub-breed as a title for the image

# Basic JavaScript + ES6
* ES6 
* Const vs Let vs Var
* Lambda/Arrow functions
* Object Destructuring 

### Project Description
* This project should be very familiar to you. You have already suffered through the logic behind a lot of these expressions/functions. 
* We're excited to give you something you've already worked on, but to now just convert the code into ES6 syntax. 
* Learning to program is all about repetition. So teaching you a new concept with material that you've already learned will help you solidify the material and also teach you new concepts along the way.
* Project files 1 - 3 are all that need to be completed for this assignment. And Project-4 is *Extra Credit*. 
* Please have fun!

### Instructions
* Fork and clone this repo.
* `cd` into this project and Run the command `npm i` to install needed node packages.
* Run the command `npm test` to run the tests.
* Work through the files and make the tests pass.
* Submit a pull request when you are finished and we will review your code.

# LS-Client-Auth

## Packages

* `redux-thunk`
* `cors`

## Topics

*  Redux Thunk
* localStorage
* axios's config object
* http headers


## Assignment

Clone down this project.  Run `npm i`.
Start your MongoDB server by running `mongod` from the command line.
Start the server (on the solution branch) of the LS-Auth repository.

Complete the SignUp component.  When the user fills out the form you should send and
axios POST request to the server to save the user to the database.  If successful then you
should save the provided JWT to localStorage and then redirect the user to `/users`.
User the existing code as a reference.

You will also need to make sure that your server is using the `cors` middleware.
Instructions for adding cors:
* `npm i --save cors`
* `const cors = require('cors');`
* `app.use(cors());`

**COMPONENTS-BEM**
----------------------------------

Topics:
* Naming Conventions
* BEM
* Constructors with ES6 class syntax

You will be turning the wireframes provided in the markups directory into a page.

Using BEM, create the page with three components: `Section`, `Box`, and `Dropdown`.
Using ES6 class constructors, complete the `Dropdown` component functionality.

Here is some Lorem Ipsum text:

`Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Fusce risus nibh, gravida nec felis quis, facilisis facilisis lectus. Nulla ac orci pretium, condimentum orci quis, accumsan nisi. Aliquam erat volutpat. Curabitur cursus mattis libero, at viverra risus hendrerit quis. Fusce imperdiet tristique tortor non tincidunt. Mauris accumsan urna nec augue feugiat porta. Proin vitae magna in ex malesuada laoreet eget a nulla. Aliquam tristique et elit at consequat. In hac habitasse platea dictumst.`

**COMPONENTS-CONSTURCTORS**
----------------------------------

Topics:
* Naming Conventions
* BEM
* Constructors with ES6 class syntax

You will be building on your prior work from Components-BEM by adding a `Tabs` component.

The HTML and CSS for the Tabs component and instance are provided so that you may add your prior work around it. If you have not finished Components-BEM, ask you TA for the solution.

You may need to adjust some of the naming for the usuage of `Box` in the HTML provided if it's different in your implementation.

## Description
  The `Tabs` component should be a grouping of links and associated items. Only one item is shown at a time, and each item is shown when its corresponding link is clicked. You should default to the first link and item upon page load.

  You will also be doing a more complex query with `querySelector` and Data Attributes. It's a great challenge to try to work out on your own. If it's holding you back too much, you may ask your TA for the solution to that query.

# Data Structures FAQ
## Contents
### General

#### My imports aren't working, help!
Python can be tricky with how imports work and can vary from environment to environment.  If you are having trouble, the easiest solution is to copy the file you want to import into the same folder as the file you want to import it into and use `from file import class`.

This is not a best practice for a real application, but it is acceptable for this exercise.  Just remember that this may mean if you want to change or update your code, you will have to do it in multiple places.

#### What are real-world use-cases for a Queue data structure?
Queues are used anywhere in which you want to work with data `First in First Out` (FIFO).  Server requests, without any prioritization, are handled this way. We'll also use it to conduct a breadth first traversal and breadth first search. 

#### What are real-world use-cases for a Stack data structure?
Stacks are used when you want to work with data `Last in First Out` (LIFO or FILO).  They're used in processor architecture,  undo logic, and depth first searches and traversals.

#### What are real-world use-cases for a Linked List data structure?
Linked Lists can be used to create `queues` and `stacks`.  They're also a key part of resolving collisions in hash tables, which we'll learn more about in a few weeks.

#### How are Linked-Lists different than an Array?
Both linked lists and arrays are linear data structures.  An array is the most space efficient type of storage possible and has great time complexity for most operations.  Logically, the array is linear in structure, and it is stored in a linear segment of memory.  It is accessed by starting at the memory address of the pointer and counting forward the number of bits resulting from the `index` times the size of the data type.  One weakness is the time complexity of operations that take data out of anywhere but the end and another is changing the size of the array.

A linked list is not as efficient for storage because each element requires a pointer to the next, and in a doubly-linked list, previous element.  It is also more difficult to access the elements.  Because there's no index, you must loop through the list to search for the item you want, which is O(n).  However, a linked list does not require a contiguous block of memory.  It has 0(1) to remove or add items anywhere in the list.

Generally speaking, it's usually best to use an array unless you expect to frequently add and remove items from anywhere other than the end.  In that case, it's better to use a linked list.  

#### I've always been able to add as much as I want to an Array and take things out from the beginning, end, or anywhere else.  It's never been a problem before, why are we bothering with all of this?
We're looking under the hood!  High level languages like Python abstract away most of the inner workings of everything we do.  Most of the time this is a good thing and most of the time it doesn't matter.  However, we're professional engineers and sometimes we need to solve problems where the details can have a major impact on success or failure.  Think about your car.  Do you know exactly how much weight you can put in it?  Probably not, nor do you need to.  But if you find yourself needing to put a load of bags of concrete in the trunk it suddenly becomes very important.  As an engineer, you'll be expected to understand when the details do and do not matter.

#### What are real-world use-cases for a LRU Cache?
An LRU cache is an efficient type of caching system that keeps recently used items and when the cache becomes full, pushes out the least recently used item in the cache.  It can be used any time a subset of data is used frequently that needs to be pulled from a source with a long lookup time.  For example, cacheing the most frequently accessed items from a database on a remote server.

#### What is the dictionary being used for in the LRU Cache?
We can't access items in a linked list directly because linked lists are not indexed.  To see if an item is already in the cache, we'd need to loop through the cache at O(n).  By also adding a dictionary to organize the nodes that are already present in memory, we index the linked list for a very small overhead cost.

#### What are real-world use-cases for a Binary Search Tree data structure?
A BST in the way that is being implemented for this project is a bit too simple to see any real-world use-cases. There are many (more complex) variants of BSTs that do see production use. One very notable variant is the [B-tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree), which is a self-balancing ordered variant of the BST. B-trees play a critical role in database and file system indexing. Other notable variants include the AVL tree, which is a self-balancing BST and the prefix tree, which is specialized for handling text.

#### How is the root element of a Binary Search Tree decided?
The first element added to a BST is the root of the tree. However, doing it this way means that it's a very simple matter to end up with a lopsided BST. If we simply insert a monotonically ascending or descending sequence of values, then the tree would essentially flatten down to a linked list, and we'd lose all the benefits that a BST is supposed to confer. Self-balancing variants of the BST exist in order to alleviate this exact problem. 

#### What is the difference between Breadth First and Depth First?
In depth first, we pick one path at each branch and keep going forward until we hit a dead end, then  backtrack and take the first branch we find.  In breadth first, we go by layers, one row deeper each time.  This means that we jump around a bit.

#### What is the difference between a Search and a Traversal?
A search and a traversal are processed exactly the same.  The difference is that we stop a search when we find what we were looking for, or when all nodes have been visited without finding it.  In a traversal, we always keep going until we've visited every node.

# Stretch Goal: Heaps

## Max Heaps
* Should have the methods `insert`, `delete`, `get_max`, `_bubble_up`, and `_sift_down`.
  * `insert` adds the input value into the heap; this method should ensure that the inserted value is in the correct spot in the heap
  * `delete` removes and returns the 'topmost' value from the heap; this method needs to ensure that the heap property is maintained after the topmost element has been removed. 
  * `get_max` returns the maximum value in the heap _in constant time_.
  * `get_size` returns the number of elements stored in the heap.
  * `_bubble_up` moves the element at the specified index "up" the heap by swapping it with its parent if the parent's value is less than the value at the specified index.
  * `_sift_down` grabs the indices of this element's children and determines which child has a larger value. If the larger child's value is larger than the parent's value, the child element is swapped with the parent.

![Image of a Heap in Array form](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Heap-as-array.svg/603px-Heap-as-array.svg.png)

## Generic Heaps
A max heap is pretty useful, but what's even more useful is to have our heap be generic such that the user can define their own priority function and pass it to the heap to use.

Augment your heap implementation so that it exhibits this behavior. If no comparator function is passed in to the heap constructor, it should default to being a max heap. Also change the name of the `get_max` function to `get_priority`.

You can test your implementation against the tests in `test_generic_heap.py`. The test expects your augmented heap implementation lives in a file called `generic_heap.py`. Feel free to change the import statement to work with your file structure or copy/paste your implementation into a file with the expected name.

# Data Structures 

Topics:
 * Singly Linked Lists
 * Queues and Stacks
 * Doubly Linked Lists
 * Binary Search Trees
 * Related Code Challenge Problems

Stretch Goals:
 * LRU Cache
 * Heaps
 * AVL Trees

## Completion Requirements
 * Module 1: Implement the Stack and Queue classes using built-in Python lists and the Node and LinkedList classes you created during the Module 1 Guided Project.
 * Module 2: Implement the Doubly Linked List class
 * Module 3: Implement the Binary Search Tree class
 * Module 4: Implement traversal methods on Binary Search Trees
 
 > NOTE: The quickest and easiest way to reliably import a file in Python is to just copy and paste the file you want to import into the same directory as the file that wants to import. This obviously isn't considered best practice, but it is the most reliable way to do it across all platforms.  If the import isn't working, feel free to try this method.

### Stacks
* Should have the methods: `push`, `pop`, and `len`.
   * `push` adds an item to the top of the stack.
   * `pop` removes and returns the element at the top of the stack
   * `len` returns the number of elements in the stack.

### Queues
 * Has the methods: `enqueue`, `dequeue`, and `len`.
   * `enqueue` adds an element to the back of the queue.
   * `dequeue` removes and returns the element at the front of the queue.
   * `len` returns the number of elements in the queue.

### Doubly Linked Lists
 * The `ListNode` class, which represents a single node in the doubly-linked list, has already been implemented for you. Inspect this code and try to understand what it is doing to the best of your ability.
 * The `DoublyLinkedList` class itself should have the methods: `add_to_head`, `add_to_tail`, `remove_from_head`, `remove_from_tail`, `move_to_front`, `move_to_end`, `delete`, and `get_max`.
   * `add_to_head` replaces the head of the list with a new value that is passed in.
   * `add_to_tail` replaces the tail of the list with a new value that is passed in.
   * `remove_from_head` removes the head node and returns the value stored in it.
   * `remove_from_tail` removes the tail node and returns the value stored in it.
   * `move_to_front` takes a reference to a node in the list and moves it to the front of the list, shifting all other list nodes down. 
   * `move_to_end` takes a reference to a node in the list and moves it to the end of the list, shifting all other list nodes up. 
   * `delete` takes a reference to a node in the list and removes it from the list. The deleted node's `previous` and `next` pointers should point to each afterwards.
   * `get_max` returns the maximum value in the list. 
 * The `head` property is a reference to the first node and the `tail` property is a reference to the last node.
 
![Image of Doubly Linked List](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Doubly-linked-list.svg/610px-Doubly-linked-list.svg.png)

### Binary Search Trees
* Should have the methods `insert`, `contains`, `get_max`.
  * `insert` adds the input value to the binary search tree, adhering to the rules of the ordering of elements in a binary search tree.
  * `contains` searches the binary search tree for the input value, returning a boolean indicating whether the value exists in the tree or not.
  * `get_max` returns the maximum value in the binary search tree.
  * `for_each` performs a traversal of _every_ node in the tree, executing the passed-in callback function on each tree node value. There is a myriad of ways to perform tree traversal; in this case any of them should work.

---

Once you've gotten the tests passing, it's time to analyze the runtime complexity of your `get` and `set` operations. There's a way to get both operations down to sub-linear time. In fact, we can get them each down to constant time by picking the right data structures to use. 

Here are you some things to think about with regards to optimizing your implementation: If you opted to use a dictionary to work with key-value pairs, we know that dictionaries give us constant access time, which is great. It's cheap and efficient to fetch pairs. A problem arises though from the fact that dictionaries don't have any way of remembering the order in which key-value pairs are added. But we definitely need something to remember the order in which pairs are added. Can you think of some ways to get around this constraint?

## Stretch Goals

### LRU Cache
An LRU (Least Recently Used) cache is an in-memory storage structure that adheres to the [Least Recently Used](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Least_recently_used_(LRU)) caching strategy. 

In essence, you can think of an LRU cache as a data structure that keeps track of the order in which elements (which take the form of key-value pairs) it holds are added and updated. The cache also has a max number of entries it can hold. This is important because once the cache is holding the max number of entries, if a new entry is to be inserted, another pre-existing entry needs to be evicted from the cache. Because the cache is using a least-recently used strategy, the oldest entry (the one that was added/updated the longest time ago) is removed to make space for the new entry. 

So what operations will we need on our cache? We'll certainly need some sort of `set` operation to add key-value pairs to the cache. Newly-set pairs will get moved up the priority order such that every other pair in the cache is now one spot lower in the priority order that the cache maintains. The lowest-priority pair will get removed from the cache if the cache is already at its maximal capacity. Additionally, in the case that the key already exists in the cache, we simply want to overwrite the old value associated with the key with the newly-specified value. 

We'll also need a `get` operation that fetches a value given a key. When a key-value pair is fetched from the cache, we'll go through the same priority-increase dance that also happens when a new pair is added to the cache.

Note that the only way for entries to be removed from the cache is when one needs to be evicted to make room for a new one. Thus, there is no explicit `remove` method. 

Given the above spec, try to get a working implementation that passes the tests. What data structure(s) might be good candidates with which to build our cache on top of? Hint: Since our cache is going to be storing key-value pairs, we might want to use a structure that is adept at handling those. 

### AVL Tree
An AVL tree (Georgy Adelson-Velsky and Landis' tree, named after the inventors) is a self-balancing binary search tree. In an AVL tree, the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one; if at any time they differ by more than one, rebalancing is done to restore this property.

We define balance factor for each node as :
```
balanceFactor = height(left subtree) - height(right subtree)
```

The balance factor of any node of an AVL tree is in the integer range [-1,+1]. If after any modification in the tree, the balance factor becomes less than −1 or greater than +1, the subtree rooted at this node is unbalanced, and a rotation is needed.

![AVL tree rebalancing](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-challenge-images/0/1436854305-b167cc766c-AVL_Tree_Rebalancing.svg.png)

Implement an AVL Tree class that exhibits the aforementioned behavior. The tree's `insert` method should perform the same logic as what was implemented for the binary search tree, with the caveat that upon inserting a new element into the tree, it will then check to see if the tree needs to be rebalanced. 

How does the time complexity of the AVL Tree's insertion method differ from the binary search tree's?

<a name="q200"></a>
### Why is there such a debate between OOP and functional programming, and why should we care?

There are a lot of [programming
paradigms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm) and they all have
their strengths and weaknesses when it comes to solving different types of
problems.

People can be quite opinionated about their favorites, but it's important to
remember that no one language or paradigm is the right tool for all jobs. And,
additionally, that virtually all problems can be solved in any of the
declarative or imperative paradigms. (Some might produce cleaner, more elegant
code for a particular problem.)

Paradigms are the hardest thing to learn because you often have to take all the
knowledge you have about solving a problem in another paradigm and throw it out
the window. You have to learn new patterns and techniques to be effective.

But we encourage this kind of learning because most popular languages are to
some degree _multi-paradigm_, and the more techniques you know from more
paradigms, the more effective you are in that multi-paradigm langage.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q300"></a>
### In regard to the code challenge solution, why is the '+' operator being used to concatenate strings? I thought we were supposed to use the join() method in Python? 

Using `join()` to join large numbers of strings is definitely faster in Python
than using the `+` operator to do it. The reason is that every time you `join()`
or use the `+` operator, a new string is created. So if you only have to
`join()` once, versus using `+` hundreds of times, you'll run faster.

That said, if you want to use the `join()` approach, you'll have to have all
your strings in a list, which uses more memory than just having the two or three
that you need at a time to use `+`. So there's a tradeoff.

Another tradeoff might be in readability. It might be easier to read the `+`
version. That's worth something.

Finally, if `+` is fast enough for this case, it might not be worth the time to
bother with making a list of strings to `join()`.

* [Speed comparison with different ways of concatenating strings](https://waymoot.org/home/python_string/)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q400"></a>
### How do you get out of the Python built-in `help`?

Hit `q` for "quit".

It's a common command in Unix "pagers" (programs that show documents a page at a
time).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q500"></a>
### Are there any helpful VS Code extensions that are recommend for using with Python?

* [Official VS Code Python Extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q600"></a>
### I'm on Windows; what command do I use to run Python?

If you're running in PowerShell or cmd, use:

```
py
```

If in bash, use `python` or `python3`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q700"></a>
### What version of Python do I need?

You should have version 3.7 or higher. Test with:

```shell
python --version
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q800"></a>
### Do I need to use pipenv?

You should. Good Python devs know how.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q900"></a>
### How do I get out of the Python REPL?

Hit `CTRL-D`. This is the way End-Of-File is signified in Unix-likes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q1000"></a>
### What does "REPL" mean?

_Read, Evaluate, Print Loop_.

It reads your input, evaluates it, and prints the result. And loops.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q1100"></a>
### I'm on a Mac and when I run Python it says I'm on version 2.7. Why?

Macs come with version 2.7 by default. You'll need to install version 3.

And preferable use `pipenv` after that.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q1200"></a>
### Does Python use tabs or spaces?

[PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) says four spaces.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q1300"></a>
### How do I convert an iterator into a list?

Cast it:

```python
list(range(5))
```

produces:

```python
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q1400"></a>
### Does Python have hoisting?

No.

* [What is hoisting?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hoisting)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q1500"></a>
### Does scoping work similar to other languages?

Generally, and also not really. Variables are either global or function-local.

Since there are no declarations, there's no block-level scope.

It is similar to `var` in JavaScript.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q1600"></a>
### Can you return a reference to a function from another function? Or store it in a variable?

Yes. Functions are [first-class citizens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_citizen).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q1700"></a>
### Can you use boolean shortcut assignments?

Yes, you can. This is common in Perl and JavaScript, but it's not particularly [idiomatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_idiom) in Python.

```python
x = SomethingFalsey or 5
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q1800"></a>
### Can you do anonymous functions?

You can use `lambda` for simple functions:

```python
adder = lambda x, y: x + y

adder(4, 5)   # 9

do_some_math(4, 5, lambda x, y: y - x)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q1900"></a>
### Is a dict like a JavaScript object?

Sort of.

The syntax is different, though. In Python you must use `[]` notation to access elements. And you must use `"` around the key names.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q2000"></a>
### What are all those method names with double underscores around them?

Those are function you typically don't need to use, but can override or call if you wish.

Most commonly used are:

* `__init__()` is the constructor for objects
* `__str__()` returns a string representation of the object
* `__repr__()` returns a string representation of the object, for debugging

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q2100"></a>
### How do I get a value from a dict?

```python
d = {
    "a": 2,
    "b": 3
}

print(d["a"])
```

You don't use dot notation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q2200"></a>
### When do we run pipenv shell?

`pipenv shell` puts you into your work environment. When you're ready to work, or run the code, or install new dependencies, you should be in your pipenv shell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q2300"></a>
### How do I get out of the pipenv shell?

Type `exit`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q2400"></a>
### How do I install additional packages from pipenv?

```shell
pipenv install packagename
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q2500"></a>
### Is it possible to use system-wide packages from inside the virtual environment?

This is [not recommended](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/diagnose/#no-module-named-module-name).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q2600"></a>
### Where are good Python docs?

* [Official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) tutorial and library reference.

The official docs might be hard to read at first, but you'll get used to them
quickly

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q2700"></a>
### Which linter?

Pylint or Flake8. The latter seems to be a bit more popular.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q2800"></a>
### Can you dynamically add new methods/properties to class through other functions? Or must all properties/methods be declared at once?

You can add them dynamically at runtime, but you have to add them to the class itself:

```python
class Foo():
    pass

f = Foo()

Foo.x = 12  # Dynamically add property to class

f.x == 12 # True!

def a_method(self):
    print("Hi")

Foo.hi = a_method  # Dynamically add method to class

f.hi()   # Prints "Hi"
```

This is not a common thing to see in Python, however.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q2900"></a>
### Following this flow: 1) class Dog is created with attributes size and weight. 2) New instance called Snoopy of class Dog is created. 3) Class Dog gets the method bark() dynamically added to it. Question: will Snoopy now have access to bark() method?

Yes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q3000"></a>
### If a subclass inherits from two superclasses with a method of the same name, which method will the subclass use?

The answer to this is twofold:

1. Lots of devs and shops frown on multiple inheritance, so maybe just don't do
   it.
   ([Discussion](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/218458/is-there-any-real-reason-multiple-inheritance-is-hated))

2. As for the order in which methods of the same name are resolved, check out
   the [MRO Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C3_linearization) which is
   what Python uses.


------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q3100"></a>
### How to handle multiple inheritance and why/when to do it in the first place?

```python
class Base1:
    pass

class Base2:
    pass

class Derived(Base1, Base2):  # Multiple inheritance
    pass
```

Sometimes multiple inheritance can lead to elegant solutions when a subclass
needs attributes from multiple, otherwise-unrelated parent classes.

However, [a lot of people find it's not worth the
trouble](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/218458/is-there-any-real-reason-multiple-inheritance-is-hated))
and opt for other solutions, like composition.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q3200"></a>
### Why use tuples instead of lists?

* Tuples are immutable. There's a school of thought that says bugs can be reduced if you make as many things immutable as you can.
* Tuples are faster than lists to access.
* Some tuples (containing primitive types), can be used as `dict` keys.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q3300"></a>
### What's the difference between __repr__ and __str__?

Generally speaking, `__repr__` is the string a dev would want to see if they
dumped an object to the screen. `__str__` is the string a user would want to see
if the object were `print()`ed.

The output of `__repr__` should be _valid Python code that can reproduce the
object_.

```python
class Goat:
    def __init__(self, leg_count):
        self.leg_count = leg_count

    def __repr__(self):
        return f'Goat(leg_count={self.leg_count})'

    def __str__(self):
        return f'a goat with {self.leg_count} legs'
```

In action:

```python
>>> g = Goat(4)
>>> str(g)
'a goat with 4 legs'
>>> g
Goat(leg_count=4)
>>> Goat(leg_count=4)  # output of __repr__ makes a clone of that object!
Goat(leg_count=4)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q3400"></a>
### How does `sys.argv` work?

It's a list that holds _command line arguments_. This is a way for a user to run
your program and specify different behavior from the command line.

Here's a small program that prints the command line arguments:

```python
import sys

for i in range(len(sys.argv)):
    print(f'Argument #{i} is: {sys.argv[i]}')
```

and here's some output, assuming you named the script `foo.py`:

```screen
$ python foo.py
Argument #0 is: foo.py
```

```screen
$ python foo.py antelope buffalo
Argument #0 is: foo.py
Argument #1 is: antelope
Argument #2 is: buffalo
```

Note that the 0th element in the list is the name of the program.

Here's another program that prints up to whatever number the user specifies:

```python
import sys

for i in range(int(sys.argv[1])):
    print(i+1)
```

Example runs:

```screen
$ python foo.py 2
1
2
```

```screen
$ python foo.py 4
1
2
3
4
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q3500"></a>
### How do I concatenate two arrays into a single array?

Use `extend()`.

```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [4, 5, 6]

a.extend(b)

print(a)   # [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ]
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q3600"></a>
### What are some ways to learn a new language?

* Figure out how variables and functions work.
* Build small toy programs to test individual features.
* Build a larger project that exercises many features.
* Don't get frustrated! Treat the problem like a curiosity, a thing to be studied.
* Do small tutorials or code-alongs.
* Find docs you like.
* Learn the differences between this language and one you know.
* Learn this language's way of doing the things you know.

Things to look for in the new language:

* Collections (arrays, vectors, dictionaries)
* Data types
* Iterators
* Flow control (if, while, loops, etc)
* Functions
* etc.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q3700"></a>
### Why test code frequently?

It's often better to make progress in small increments than to write a bunch of
stuff and test it in one go.

Also, it's easier to stay motivated if you spend 10 minutes getting a first
version going, even if it's missing 99% of its features, and then starting to
iterate on that.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q3800"></a>
### Why isn't official documentation more helpful than Stack Overflow?

Often official documentation is more geared toward being a concise reference.
Stack Overflow is more of an example-based learning environment.

Sometimes you need to know the specific details. In those cases, you can dig
into the spec, with all it's lawyerly language, and try to decipher what it is
you have to do.

Other times, you just need a getting-started example, and Stack Overflow is
great for that.

Both types of documentation have their purpose.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q3900"></a>
### During an interview, what do I do if I can't remember the exact syntax?

Just say so.

"I can't remember how to add an element to the end of the list in Python... is
it `push()`? In any case, we'll call the function here that does that."

(Turns out it's `append()` in Python, but being honest and describing what it is
your're trying to do will get you 99% of the way there in an interview.)

# Intro to Python I

_Note: This project spans two modules (modules 1 and 2). You should roughly try to finish the first half of the problems during module 1 and the second half of the problems during module 2._

It's time to learn a new language! Python!

Python is a popular, easy-to-use programming language that has significant
traction in the field.

Remember the goal is _learning to learn_, so keep track of what works for you
and what doesn't as you go through the process of exploring Python.

## Techniques for learning new languages

* Try to relate things you already know in another language (e.g. what an
  _array_ is) to the corresponding things in Python (e.g. a _list_) and how to
  use them.

* Write a bunch of "toy programs" that demonstrate different key features of the
  language

* Explore the standard library that's available for the language. Skim it
  briefly for now--the idea isn't to memorize everything but to file away
  generally what functionality is available.

* Write a more substantial toy program that uses a variety of the features.

Again, keep track of what works for you. Try different things to see what works
best for learning new languages.

## Resources

* [Installing Python 3](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/CS-Wiki/wiki/Installing-Python-3)
* [JavaScript<->Python cheatsheet](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/CS-Wiki/wiki/Javascript-Python-cheatsheet)
* [How to read Specs and Code](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/CS-Wiki/wiki/How-to-Read-Specifications-and-Code)
* [Python 3 standard library](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/)

## Getting started

Make sure you have Python 3 installed. You can check this by running `python3 --version` in your terminal and ensuring that it returns a version string that is at least 3.6.5. 

## Goals

* Learn the basic syntax and structure of Python

## Summary

* Implement a number of tiny Python programs that demonstrate Python syntax and
  language concepts.

## Instructions

_Note: This project spans two modules (modules 1 and 2). You should roughly try to finish the first half of the problems during module 1 and the second half of the problems during module 2._

Each directory inside the `src/` directory presents exercises revolving around a
particular concept in Python. Not all of these concepts are unique to Python (in
fact, most probably aren't). This means that you can leverage knowledge you've
obtained via exposure to other programming languages towards learning Python. 

The suggested order for going through each of the directories is: 

* `hello` -- Hello world
* `bignum` -- Print some big numbers
* `datatypes` -- Experiment with type conversion
* `modules` -- Learn to import from modules
* `printing` -- Formatted print output
* `lists` -- Python's version of arrays
* `tuples` -- Immutable lists typically for heterogenous data
* `slices` -- Accessing parts of lists
* `comprehensions` -- List comprehensions
* `dictionaries` -- Dictionaries
* `functions` -- Functions
* `args` -- Arguments and Keyword Arguments
* `scopes` -- Global, Local, and Non-Local scope
* `file_io` -- Read and write from files
* `cal` -- Experiment with module imports and implement a text-based calendar
* `classes` -- Classes and objects

## Stretch Goals

1. One of Python's main philosophical tenets is its emphasis on readability. To
   that end, the Python community has standardized around a style guide called
   [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). Take a look at it and
   then go over the code you've written and make sure it adheres to what PEP 8
   recommends. Alternatively, PEP 8 linters exist for most code editors (you can
   find instructions on installing a Python linter for VSCode
   [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/linting)). Try installing
   one for your editor!

2. Rewrite code challenges you've solved before or projects you've implemented
   before in a different language in Python. Start getting in as much practice
   with the language as possible!

3. Write a program to determine if a number, given on the command line, is prime.

   1. How can you optimize this program?
   2. Implement [The Sieve of
      Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes), one
      of the oldest algorithms known (ca. 200 BC).

# FAQ

[Refer to the FAQ in Intro-Python-I](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/Intro-Python-I/blob/master/FAQ.md).




### [1-projects/Intro-Python-II-master/object_reference_hints.md](1-projects/Intro-Python-II-master/object_reference_hints.md)

Remember that multiple variables can refer to the same object.

In the diagram below, there are only 2 `Room` objects, total. (There are more in the game, obviously, but in this diagram, there are 2.)

There are 5 variables. 3 of them point to the one Room object that is the foyer:

* `room['foyer']`
* `room['outside'].n_to`
* `player.location`

The remaining 2 point to the one Room object that is the outside:

* `room['outside']`
* `room['foyer'].s_to`

```
room['outside'] -> Room("Outside Cave Entrance")
                               ^
                               |
                     room['foyer'].s_to


room['foyer'] -> Room("Foyer") <- player.location
                     ^
                     |
              room['outside'].n_to
```

If you want to move the player (who is in the foyer in the diagram) to another room, you just need to reassign that to any variable that points to that other room.

So if the player is in the foyer and types `s` to go south, we could set:

```
player.location = room['foyer'].s_to  # we were in the foyer, then went south
```

and after that, the variable references would look like this, with player location pointing to the outside object:

```
                        player.location
                               |
                               v
room['outside'] -> Room("Outside Cave Entrance")
                               ^
                               |
                     room['foyer'].s_to


room['foyer'] -> Room("Foyer")
                     ^
                     |
              room['outside'].n_to
```

_Assigning doesn't copy the object. It just makes another reference to the same object._

# Intro to Python II

Up to this point, you've gotten your feet wet by working on a bunch of small Python programs. In this module, we're going to continue to solidify your Python chops by implementing a full-featured project according to a provided specification.


## What We're Building
[What's an Adventure Game? ![vid](https://tk-assets.lambdaschool.com/7928cdb4-b8a3-45a6-b231-5b9d1fc1e002_ScreenShot2019-03-22at5.47.28PM.png)](https://youtu.be/WaZccFqJUT8)


## Goals

* Put your Python basics into practice by implementing a text adventure game

* Practice writing code that conforms to a specification


## MVP

### Day 1 MVP

* Create the input command parser in `adv.py` which allows the program to receive player input and commands to move to rooms
  in the four cardinal directions.
* Fill out Player and Room classes in `player.py` and `room.py`

### Day 2 MVP

* Make rooms able to hold multiple items
* Make the player able to carry multiple items
* Add items to the game that the user can carry around
* Add `get [ITEM_NAME]` and `drop [ITEM_NAME]` commands to the parser

## Specification

The `/src` directory contains the files `adv.py`, which is where the main logic for the game should live, `room.py`, which will contain the definition of the Room class, and `player.py`, which will contain the definition of the Player class.


* Add a REPL parser to `adv.py` that accepts directional commands to move the player
  * After each move, the REPL should print the name and description of the player's current room
  * Valid commands are `n`, `s`, `e` and `w` which move the player North, South, East or West
  * The parser should print an error if the player tries to move where there is no room.

* Put the Room class in `room.py` based on what you see in `adv.py`.

  * The room should have `name` and `description` attributes.

  * The room should also have `n_to`, `s_to`, `e_to`, and `w_to` attributes
    which point to the room in that respective direction.

* Put the Player class in `player.py`.
  * Players should have a `name` and `current_room` attributes


* Create a file called `item.py` and add an `Item` class in there.

  * The item should have `name` and `description` attributes.

     * Hint: the name should be one word for ease in parsing later.

  * This will be the _base class_ for specialized item types to be declared
    later.

* Add the ability to add items to rooms.

  * The `Room` class should be extended with a `list` that holds the `Item`s
    that are currently in that room.

  * Add functionality to the main loop that prints out all the items that are
    visible to the player when they are in that room.

* Add capability to add `Item`s to the player's inventory. The inventory can
  also be a `list` of items "in" the player, similar to how `Item`s can be in a
  `Room`.

* Add a new type of sentence the parser can understand: two words.

  * Until now, the parser could just understand one sentence form:

     `verb`

    such as "n" or "q".

  * But now we want to add the form:

    `verb` `object`

    such as "take coins" or "drop sword".

  * Split the entered command and see if it has 1 or 2 words in it to determine
    if it's the first or second form.

* Implement support for the verb `get` followed by an `Item` name. This will be
  used to pick up `Item`s.

  * If the user enters `get` or `take` followed by an `Item` name, look at the
    contents of the current `Room` to see if the item is there.

     * If it is there, remove it from the `Room` contents, and add it to the
       `Player` contents.

     * If it's not there, print an error message telling the user so.

     * Add an `on_take` method to `Item`.

        * Call this method when the `Item` is picked up by the player.

        * `on_take` should print out "You have picked up [NAME]" when you pick up an item.

        * The `Item` can use this to run additional code when it is picked up.

     * Add an `on_drop` method to `Item`. Implement it similar to `on_take`.

* Implement support for the verb `drop` followed by an `Item` name. This is the
  opposite of `get`/`take`.

* Add the `i` and `inventory` commands that both show a list of items currently
  carried by the player.


## Stretch Goals

In arbitrary order:

* Add more rooms

* Add scoring

* Subclass items into treasures

* Add a subclass to `Item` called `LightSource`.

  * During world creation, add a `lamp` `LightSource` to a convenient `Room`.

  * Override `on_drop` in `LightSource` that tells the player "It's not wise to
  drop your source of light!" if the player drops it. (But still lets them drop
  it.)

  * Add an attribute to `Room` called `is_light` that is `True` if the `Room` is
  naturally illuminated, or `False` if a `LightSource` is required to see what
  is in the room.

  * Modify the main loop to test if there is light in the `Room` (i.e. if
    `is_light` is `True` **or** there is a `LightSource` item in the `Room`'s
    contents **or** if there is a `LightSource` item in the `Player`'s contents).

  * If there is light in the room, display name, description, and contents as
    normal.

  * If there isn't, print out "It's pitch black!" instead.

  * Hint: `isinstance` might help you figure out if there's a `LightSource`
    among all the nearby `Item`s.

  * Modify the `get`/`take` code to print "Good luck finding that in the dark!" if
  the user tries to pick up an `Item` in the dark.

* Add methods to notify items when they are picked up or dropped

* Add light and darkness to the game

* Add more items to the game.

* Add a way to win.

* Add more to the parser.

  * Remember the last `Item` mentioned and substitute that if the user types
    "it" later, e.g.

    ```
    take sword
    drop it
    ```

  * Add `Item`s with adjectives, like "rusty sword" and "silver sword".

    * Modify the parser to handle commands like "take rusty sword" as well as
      "take sword".

      * If the user is in a room that contains both the rusty sword _and_ silver
        sword, and they type "take sword", the parser should say, "I don't know
        which you mean: rusty sword or silver sword."

* Modify the code that calls `on_take` to check the return value. If `on_take`
  returns `False`, then don't continue picking up the object. (I.e. prevent the
  user from picking it up.)

  * This enables you to add logic to `on_take` to code things like "don't allow
    the user to pick up the dirt unless they're holding the shovel.

* Add monsters.

* Add the `attack` verb that allows you to specify a monster to attack.

* Add an `on_attack` method to the monster class.

* Similar to the `on_take` return value modification, above, have `on_attack`
  prevent the attack from succeeding unless the user possesses a `sword` item.

* Come up with more stretch goals! The sky's the limit!

## Questions

<a name="q100"></a>
### `runtests.sh: $'\r': command not found` or `Syntax error: word unexpected (expecting "do")`

If you see this error:

```shell
Running unit tests:
: not foundtests.sh: 2: ./tests/runtests.sh:
./tests/runtests.sh: 4: ./tests/runtests.sh: Syntax error: word unexpected (expecting "do")
```

You have two options:

1. Open the file `tests/runtests.sh` in VS Code in whatever subproject folder
   you're working in, e.g. `fizzbuzz`. Click on the lower right of the screen
   where it says `CRLF`. Choose `LF`. Save the file. Then the error should go
   away.

2. You can do this from the command line with the `tr` command:

```shell
cd tests
cat runtests.sh | tr -d '\r' > runtests.tmp
mv runtests.tmp runtests.sh
```

The root of the problem is a setting in git that causes all newlines (LF) to
be converted to carriage-return/newline (CRLF). The script `runtests.sh` is a
_bash script_ that bash runs, and bash *hates* `\r` and pukes everywhere.

To cause git to _not_ do newline conversion for future clones, run the
following:

```
git config --global core.autocrlf false
```

### Mac: `malformed object` error when running `make tests`

This is caused by an older version of the `ar` and `ranlib` packages being installed.
Sometimes these conflict with the versions installed with xcode.

If running MacPorts:

```
sudo port selfupdate
sudo port upgrade cctools
```

If running Brew:

```
sudo brew update
sudo brew upgrade gcc
```

### Should I bother fixing compiler warnings?

YES!

In C, a warning is the compiler saying, "I can build that, and I will, but it's
probably going to do something really messed up that you don't want."

There are only a few warnings you can safely ignore.

If you're _absolutely sure_ the "unused variable" warning is OK, then you could ignore it. Or, better, add a line of code that silences the warning:

```c
void foo(int a)
{
    (void)a; // Do nothing, but at least the compiler will be quiet
```

### Can I accidentally destroy my computer running C code?

Nope! Not with a modern OS.

If you're running MS-DOS, then sure, you can do all kinds of things.
I once accidentally blew away all my BIOS settings with a program I
wrote and my computer wouldn't boot.

But Windows, Linux, macOS, BSD, or any other mainstream OS from this century all
offer memory and resource protection that prevents you from changing memory
you're not supposed to, or wiping out a disk you're not supposed to, etc.

The worst you'll see is a `Segmentation fault` message which means your program
tried to do something bad and the OS killed it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Is a `struct` comparable to something in Python or JS? Is it like a class?

It's like a class, except with only data (fields, properties) attached to it.
There are no methods (functions) associated with it.

If you _really_ want to pretend that you have methods on a `struct`, you can add
them as fields that are _pointers to functions_. The syntax is pretty obtuse,
and it's not a natural or idiomatic thing to do in C.

Example:

```c
struct animal {
    char *name;

    // make_sound is a pointer to a function with no parameters that returns void
    void (*make_sound)(void);
}

// Note how bleat() matches the signature for make_sound(), above
void bleat(void)
{
    printf("Baaaahhhh!\n");
}

int main(void)
{
    struct animal goat;

    // C doesn't have the concept of a constructor, so we have to do it by hand:

    goat.name = "goat";
    goat.make_sound = bleat;

    // Call the "method":

    goat.make_sound(); // Baaaahhhh!
}
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q700"></a>
### Can you have default parameters in the structs?

No. The best you can do is have a helper function set the defaults.

```c
void foo_default(struct foo *f)
{
    f->a = 10; // Set defaults
    f->b = 20;
    f->c = 30;
}
```

```c
struct foo x;

foo_default(&x); // Set defaults

x.a = 99; // Override default
```

When you declare a `struct`, you can also use an initializer to set the field
values:

```c
struct foo x = { .a = 10, .b = 20, .c = 30 };
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q800"></a>
### Why does unsigned char type accept a number when it's clearly referring to a character?

Deep down, computers just deal in numbers (`1`s and `0`s). They don't know what
a character is. We humans have come up with a system wherein a number
_represents_ a certain character. For example, we've agreed that `A` is `65`.

(For information on what number represents what character, look up more detail
on [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) encoding, or its modern superset
[UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8).)

With that in mind, C really only deals in numbers. Even when you put a character
in single quotes, it's still just a number. The only difference is in how we
_interpret_ that number. That is, is it a value, like 65, or is it a character,
like `A`?

```c
unsigned char c = 'A';

printf("%c\n", c); // Prints "A"
printf("%d\n", c); // Prints 65
```

```c
unsigned char c = 'A';
int x = c + 10;

printf("%d", x); // Prints 75, since 'A' == 65
```

In C, whenever you have a character in single quotes like `'A'`, the compiler
treats it just like you'd put the number `65` there. (Or `66` for `'B'`, and so
on.)

The only difference between `unsigned char` and `unsigned int` is the number of
bytes that are used to represent the number. A `char` is onGe byte, and an `int`
is typically 4 bytes (but not always).

You can think of these additional bytes as analogous to adding more digits to
your numbers. The more digits you have, the more range you can store. Two
decimal digits only gets you from 0 to 99, but 8 digits gets you from 0 to
99999999. Similarly, one byte only gets you from 0 to 255, but 4 bytes gets you
from 0 to 4,294,967,295.

If you never needed numbers larger than 255, you could use `unsigned char` for
all your variables! (But since modern computers are at least as fast with `int`s
as they are with `char`s, people just use `int`s.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q900"></a>
### When I pass an array as an argument to a function, when do I use pointer notation and when do I use array notation ?

It's a little-known FunFact that C doesn't actually pass entire arrays to
functions. It only passes pointers to the first element in that array.

```c
int a[2000];

// "a" is a pointer to the first element in the array.
// It's the same as &(a[0]).
foo(a);
```

So when you declare your function, you can do any of these:

```c
void foo(int *a)
```
```c
void foo(int a[])
```
```c
void foo(int a[1])
```
```c
void foo(int a[2000])
```
```c
void foo(int a[999999999])
```

and it treats them all as if you'd used:

```c
void foo(int *a)
```

There's a difference if you want to use multidimensional arrays. You must
declare all the dimensions except the first one, which is optional. The compiler
needs to know the other dimensions so it can do its array indexing computations
correctly.

```c
int foo(int x[][30]) // 30 wide
{
    return x[2][4];
}

int main(void)
{
    int a[10][30]; // 30 wide

    foo(a);
```

This only applies for multidimensional arrays. For 1-dimensional arrays, the
rule still applies; you still need to specify all dimensions except the first
one... but since there is only one, you never need to specify it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q1000"></a>
### Why do functions tend to return pointers to structs, and not just copies of the struct?

It's possible to do this:

```c
struct foo my_func(void)
{
    struct foo f;

    f.x = 10;

    return f; // Return a copy of f
}
```

as opposed to:

```c
struct foo *my_func(void)
{
    struct foo *p = malloc(sizeof(struct foo));

    p->x = 10;

    return p; // Return a copy of p
}
```

But in C, it's more idiomatic to return a copy of the pointer to the memory
allocated than it is to return a copy of the `struct` itself.

Part of the reason for this is that it takes time to copy data. A `struct` can
be very large depending on how many fields it has in it, but your average
pointer is only 8 bytes.

Since every time you `return` a thing, a copy of that thing gets made, it is
faster to copy a pointer than it is to copy a `struct` of any non-trivial size.

Finally, note that this variant always invokes undefined behavior and should
never be used:

```c
struct foo *my_func(void)
{
    struct foo f;

    f.x = 10;

    return &f; // Return a copy of a pointer to f
}
```

The reason is because `f` vaporizes as soon as the function returns (since it's
just a local variable), so any pointers to it are invalid.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q1100"></a>
### Why do we subtract '0' from a char to convert it from ASCII to a numeric value?

The code typically looks like this:

```c
char c = '2';  // ASCII '2'

int v = c - '0'; // Convert into numeric value 2

printf("%d\n", v); // prints decimal 2
```

Remember that in C, a `char` is like a small `int`, and when you have a
character in single quotes like `'2'`, C replaces that with the
[ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) value of that character.

In the case of our example, the ASCII value of `'2'` is `50`. And we want to
convert that to the numeric value `2`. So we clearly have to subtract `48` from
it, since `50 - 48 = 2`. But why the `'0'`, then?

Here's part of the ASCII table, just the numbers:

| Character | ASCII value |
| :-------: | :---------: |
|   `'0'`   |     48      |
|   `'1'`   |     49      |
|   `'2'`   |     50      |
|   `'3'`   |     51      |
|   `'4'`   |     52      |
|   `'5'`   |     53      |
|   `'6'`   |     54      |
|   `'7'`   |     55      |
|   `'8'`   |     56      |
|   `'9'`   |     57      |

It's no coincidence it's done this way. Turns out that if you subtract `48` from
any ASCII character that is a digit, you'll end up with the numeric value of
that ASCII character.

Example: `'7'` is value `55` (from the table), compute `55 - 48` and you get
`7`.

And since `'0'` is `48`, it's become idiomatic in C to convert ASCII digits to
values by subtracting `'0'` from them.

### When do I need a pointer to a pointer?

There are a few reasons you might need one, but the most common is when you pass
a pointer to a function, and the function needs to modify the pointer.

Let's take a step back and see when you just need to use a pointer.

```c
void foo(int a)
{
    a = 12;
}

int main(void)
{
    int x = 30;

    printf("%d\n", x); // prints 30

    foo(x);

    printf("%d\n", x); // prints 30 again--not 12! Why?
}
```

In the above example, `foo()` wants to modify the value of `x` back in main.
But, alas, it can only modify the value of `a`. When you call a function, all
arguments get _copied_ into their respective parameters. `a` is merely a _copy_
of `x`, so modifying `a` has no effect on `x`.

What if we want to modify `x` from `foo()`, though? This is where we have to use
a pointer.

```c
void foo(int *a)
{
    *a = 12; // Set the thing `a` points at to 12
}

int main(void)
{
    int x = 30;

    printf("%d\n", x); // prints 30

    foo(&x);

    printf("%d\n", x); // prints 12!
}
```

In this example, `foo()` gets a copy of a pointer to `x`. (Everything gets
copied into the parameters when you make a call, even pointers.)

Then it changes the thing the pointer points to to `12`. That pointer was
pointing to `x` back in main, so it changes `x`'s value to `12`.

Great!

So what about pointers to pointers? It's the same idea. Let's do a broken
example:

```c
void alloc_ints(int *p, int count)
{
    p = malloc(sizeof(int) * count); // Allocate space for ints
}

int main(void)
{
    int *q = NULL;

    alloc_ints(q, 10); // Alloc space for 10 ints

    printf("%p\n", q); // Prints NULL still!!

    q[2] = 10;  // UNDEFINED BEHAVIOR, CRASH?
}
```

What happened?

When we call `alloc_ints()`, a _copy_ of `q` is made in `p`. We then assign into
`p` with the `malloc()`, but since `p` is just a copy of `q`, `q` is unaffected.

It's just like our first version of `foo()`, above.

Solution? We need to pass a pointer to `q` to `alloc_ints()` so that
`alloc_ints()` can modify the value of `q`.

But `q` is already a pointer! It's an `int *`! So when we take the address-of it
(AKA get a pointer to it), we'll end up with a pointer to a pointer, or an `int
**`!

```c
void alloc_ints(int **p, int count)
{
    // Allocate space for ints, store the result in the thing that
    // `p` points to, namely `q`:

    *p = malloc(sizeof(int) * count);
}

int main(void)
{
    int *q = NULL;

    alloc_ints(&q, 10); // Alloc space for 10 ints

    printf("%p\n", q); // Prints some big number, good!

    q[2] = 10;  // works!
}
```

Success!

### Do other languages use pointers?

Most all of them do, but some are more explicit about it than others. In
languages like Go, C, C++, and Rust, you have to use the proper operators when
using pointers and references.

But languages like JavaScript and Python do a lot of that stuff behind your
back. Take this Python example:

```python
class Foo:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.x = x

def bar(a):
    a.x = 12 # Sets `f.x` to 12--why?

    a = None # Does NOT destroy `f`--why not?


f = Foo(2)

print(f.x) # Prints 2

bar(f)

print(f.x) # Prints 12--why?
```

Let's look what happened there. We made a new object `f`, and we passed that
object to function `bar()`, which modified its `x` property.

After enough time with Python, we learn that it passes objects _by reference_.
This is another way of saying it's using pointers behind your back. Behind the
scenes in Python, `a` is a pointer to `f`.

That's why when we modify `a.x`, it actually modifies `f.x`.

And it's also why when we set `a` to `None`, it doesn't change `f` at all. `a`
is just a pointer to `f`, not `f` itself.

Let's look at the C version of that Python program. This works exactly the same way:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

struct foo {
    int x;
};

void bar(struct foo *a)
{
    a->x = 12;   // Sets f.x to 12--why?

    a = NULL;    // Does NOT destroy `f`--why not?
}

int main(void)
{
    struct foo f = { 2 };

    printf("%d\n", f.x); // Prints 2

    bar(&f);

    printf("%d\n", f.x); // Prints 12--why?
}
```

`a` is a pointer to `f`. So we when do `a->x`, we're saying "set the `x`
property on the thing that `a` points to".

And when we set `a` to `NULL`, it's just modifying `a`, not the thing that `a`
points to (namely `f`).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### What's the difference between "`int *x`" and "`int* x`"?

Syntactically, nothing. They're equivalent.

That said, the recommendation is that you use the form `int *x`.

Here's why. These two lines are equivalent:

```c
int* x, y;
```

```c
int *x, y;
```

In both of them, `x` is type `int*`, and `y` is type `int`. But by putting the
asterisk right next to the `int`, it makes it look like both `x` and `y` are of
type `int*`, when in fact only `x` is.

If we reverse the order of `x` and `y`, we must necessarily move the asterisk
with `x`:

```c
int y, *x; // Also equivalent to the previous two examples
```

It's idiomatic to keep the asterisk tucked up next to the variable that's the
pointer.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q1500"></a>
### What does the "implicit declaration of function" warning mean?

This is the compiler saying "Hey, you're calling a function but I haven't seen a
declaration for that function yet." Basically you're calling a function before
you've declared it.

If you're calling a library function like `printf()` or a syscall like `stat()`,
the most common cause of this warning is failure to `#include` the header file
associated with that function. Check the `man` page for exactly which.

But what if you're getting the error on one of your own functions? Again, it
means you're calling that function before you've declared it.

But what does _declared_ mean?

A declaration can either be a function definition, or a function prototype.

Let's look at a broken example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    foo(); // Implicit declaration warning!!
}

void foo(void)
{
    printf("Foo!\n");
}
```

In that example, `main()` calls `foo()`, but the compiler hasn't seen a
declaration of `foo()` yet. We can fix it by defining `foo()` _before_ `main()`:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Just moved foo()'s definition before main(), that's all

void foo(void)
{
    printf("Foo!\n");
}

int main(void)
{
    foo(); // No problem!
}
```

You can also use a _function prototype_ to declare a function before it is used,
like so:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void foo(void); // This is the prototype! It's a declaration of foo().

int main(void)
{
    foo(); // No problem
}

void foo(void) // This is the definition of foo()
{
    printf("Foo!\n");
}
```

Prototypes for functions that are callable from other source files typically
go in header files, and then those other source files `#include` them.

For functions that aren't used outside the current `.c` file (e.g. little helper
functions that no other file will even need to call), those usually are either
defined at the top of the file before their first call. If that's inconvenient,
a prototype can be placed at the top of the `.c` file, instead.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q1600"></a>
### What's the difference between `puts()`, `fprintf()`, and `printf()`?

`puts()` simply outputs a string. It does no formatting of variables. Its only
argument is a single string. Additionally, it prints a newline at the end for
you.

```c
// This prints "Hello, world %d!" and then a newline:
puts("Hello, world %d!");
```

`printf()` does formatted output of variables, and strings as well. It's a
superset of `puts()`, in that way.

```c
int x = 12;

// This prints "Hello, world 12!\n":
printf("Hello, world %d!\n", x);
```

`fprintf()` is just like `printf()`, except it allows you to print to an open file.

```c
FILE *fp = fopen("foo.txt", "w");
int x = 12;

// This writes "Hello, world 12!\n" to the file "foo.txt":
fprintf(fp, "Hello, world %d!\n", x);
```

Incidentally, there's already a file open for you called `stdout` (_standard
output_) which normally prints to the screen. These two lines are equivalent:

```c
printf("Hello, world!\n");
fprintf(stdout, "Hello, world!\n"); // Same thing!
```

There's another already-opened file called `stderr` (_standard error_) that is
typically used to print error messages. Example:

```c
if (argc != 2) {
    fprintf(stderr, "You must specify a command line argument!\n");
    exit(1);
}
```

<a name="q1700"></a>
### Why does `025 == 21`?

In C, any time you have a plain leading `0` on front of a number, the compiler
thinks your number is _base-8_ or _octal_.

Converting `025` to decimal can be done like so:

`2*8 + 5*1 = 16 + 5 = 21`

Octal is rarely used in practice, and it's common for new C programmers to put
`0` in front of a number in error.

One of the last common places to see octal numbers is in [Unix file
permissions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system_permissions#Numeric_notation).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q1800"></a>
### What is the "true dev workflow" in C?

There is none.

Initially, it was in a Unix-like system probably using
[Makefiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makefile) to build the software. This
is the system we use at Lambda.

And modern C development under Unix still follows this pattern, except maybe
using [autotools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Build_System) or
[CMake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMake).

But dev for specific platforms like Windows probably happens in [Visual
Studio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Visual_Studio) instead of using
`make` and the rest of it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q1900"></a>
### Does C have garbage collection?

Nope!

When it comes to freeing up memory that is no longer needed by the program,
there are basically two schools of thought:

* Have the programmer manually manage that memory by explicitly allocating and
  freeing it. (C's `malloc()` and `free()` functions.)
* Have the runtime automatically manage all that for you. (Garbage collection,
  automatic reference counting, etc.)

C is too low-level to automatically manage memory usage for you.

One exception is that C automatically allocates and frees _local variables_ just
like other languages you're used to. You don't have to explicitly call `free()`
for locals (and it's an error to do so). You must call free for any and all
pointers to data that you got back from `malloc()` when you're done with them.

Also, when a program exits, all memory associated with it is freed by the OS,
whether locals or `malloc()`d data.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q2000"></a>
### Why is C code faster than other languages?

The big thing is _interpreted_ versus _compiled_.

Python and JavaScript are interpreted languages, which means another program
runs your program. It's software running software. So you run python code with
the `python` program and JavaScript code with `node`, for example.

So in that case, we have the CPU running `python`, and the Python running your
Python program. Python is the middleman, and that takes execution time.

C is a compiled language. The compiler takes your C code, and produces machine
code. The CPU runs it directly. No middleman, so it's faster.

But other languages are compiled (like Go, Swift, Rust, C++, and so on). Why is
C faster than them, typically?

It's because C is a no-frills, minimalist language. The code you write in C is
actually quite close to the machine code that gets produced by the compiler, so
it doesn't have to do a lot of things behind your back.

Additionally, people have been working on optimizing the output from C compilers
for over 45 years. That's a big head start over other languages.

### What is a segmentation fault and how do I stop it?

It means you've accessed some memory you weren't supposed to. The OS killed your
process to prevent it from doing so.

The trick is to find the line that's causing the problem. If you get a debugger
installed, this can really help.

In lieu of that, use well-positioned `printf` calls to figure out what the last
thing your program does before it crashes.

The bug almost certainly has to do with pointers or arrays (which are just
pointers behind syntactic sugar).

Maybe you're accessing a `NULL` pointer, or an array out of bounds, or modifying
something you're not allowed to modify.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q2200"></a>
### What happens if my program exits but I forgot to `free()` some memory I allocated?

All memory associated with a process is freed when the program exits, even if
you forgot to `free()` it.

It's considered shoddy programming to not `free()` all the things you
`malloc()`d, though. The OS will free it, but it's bad style to rely on that.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q2300"></a>
### What's the difference between a `float` and a `double`, or between an `int` and a `long`?

It's all about the range of numbers you want to be able to store.

`double` can hold a more precise number than a `float`.

A `float` might only be precise up to `3.14159`, but a `double` could hold
`3.1416925358979`, for example.

Likewise, an `int` might only be able to hold numbers up to 2 billion or so, but
a `long` could hold much larger numbers.

Use as little as you need. If a `float` or `int` can do the job, use them. If
you need more precision or larger numbers, step up to the next larger type.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q2400"></a>
### Can you use `+` to concatenate two strings?

No.

The reason is that strings are represented as `char*` types, and adding two
`char*`s together is not a defined operation in C.

Use the `strcat()` function in `<string.h>` to concatenate one string onto
another.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q2500"></a>
### Are variables automatically initialized to zero when I declare them?

No.

Always explicitly initialize your variables, whether they be pointers or regular
types. If you don't, random garbage will be in them when you use them.

> Exception: local variable declared with `static` storage class (this concept
> is out of scope for Lambda) and global variables get initialized to zero
> automatically. But it's still good form to explicitly initialize them.

### What type should I use to hold numbers bigger than an `int` can hold?

If you don't need negative numbers, try `unsigned int`.

If that's not enough, try `long`.

If that's not big enough, try `long long` (yes, that's a real thing).

If those aren't enough, try `unsigned long long`.

If you just need big numbers, but not a lot of precision, you can use `double` or `long double`.

If you need big numbers _and_ a lot of precision _and_ none of the above are big
enough, check out the [GNU Multiple Precision library](https://gmplib.org/). It
does arbitrary precision arithmetic to as much precision as you have RAM.

### What VS Code plugins are good for C development?

"C/C++ IntelliSense, debugging, and code browsing" by Microsoft is a good one.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q2800"></a>
### What are some additional C resources?

A great C book is _The C Programming Language_ Second Edition, by Kernighan [the
"g" is silent] and Ritchie. It's affectionately referred to simply as _K&R2_.

A less great book that is free online is [Beej's Guide to C
Programming](https://beej.us/guide/bgc/).

A good, comprehensive FAQ is the [comp.lang.c FAQ](http://c-faq.com/).

There's no "one true source" of C info online, unfortunately.

Googling `printf example`, for example, will get you good results.

Googling `man printf` will bring up the `man` page for `printf`.

### How do I get the debugger working?

The commonly-used debugger is called `gdb` (GNU Debugger).

Lambda's own Brian Ruff got it working on the Mac, and made a
[video](https://youtu.be/BgMOqjdpy5Y) covering it.

[These
instructions](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/03/debug-c-program-using-gdb/)
are reported good for WSL on Windows.

[The CS Wiki
page](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/CS-Wiki/wiki/C-and-Cpp-Debugging-in-VS-Code)
might help, but it's slightly outdated since VS Code is in heavy development.

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWIs6Kv1MvE) is reported good, as
well.

If you're not seeing program output in the `Output` tab, try adding this to your
`launch.json`:

```json
"externalConsole": true
```

We recommend Googling for `vscode gdb setup macos`, substituting whatever
platform you're on for `macos` and setting the search date range to be recent.

### How do I print a pointer with `printf`?

Use the `%p` format specifier. This will print the value of the pointer (i.e.
the memory address), not what it's pointing to (i.e. the value stored at that
memory address.)

In practice, pointers are rarely printed except for debugging.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q3100"></a>
### Does C have closures?

No, not in the way that you're used to from higher-level languages. What C does have that essentially acts as a poor man's closure is function pointers. These are literally what their name implies: pointers to functions. 

The standard library implementation of the quicksort sorting algorithm provides a good example of this. It's function signature is 
```
void qsort(void *base, size_t nitems, size_t size, int (*compare)(const void *, const void *))
```

The parameter to notice is the `int (*compare)(const void *, const void *)`. This is a function pointer, mainly denoted by the asterisk in front of the function name all wrapped in parentheses and followed by another set of parentheses containing a parameter signature. 

This signature is saying that the `qsort` function, in addition to the other parameters it receives, also receives a pointer to a function that receives two `const void *`s and returns an `int`. 

Function pointers are used to fulfill the same use case as closures. They can be used to pass some dynamic logic into another function. In the case of `qsort`, the function pointer points to a function that specifies how the comparison for the sorting should be done.

### If I look at an uninitialized variable, will the garbage in it ever be leftover data from another process?

Not on a modern OS. It would be a security risk, so the OS makes sure this never
happens.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q3300"></a>
### How many levels of indirection can you have with pointers? `int******`?

It's effectively unlimited. But the more you have, the less readable your code
is.

In real life:

* 99.8% (roughly) of pointer usage is single indirection, like `int*`.
* 1.5% (roughly) is double indirection, like `char**`.
* And the remaining 0.5% is the rest of it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q3400"></a>
### What's the `incompatible integer to pointer conversion` error?

This means you have a type mismatch in your assignment.

One side of the `=` has pointer type, and the other side has integer type.

If you have a pointer in your assignment, both side of the `=` must be the same
pointer type.

Maybe you meant to take the address of the right hand side? Or dereference the
right hand side?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q3500"></a>
### Are there any other ways besides `malloc()` to store things on the heap?

Short answer: no.

(We're assuming that by `malloc()` we mean `malloc()`, `calloc()`, and
`realloc()`.)

The longer answer is that you can make a syscall and request more RAM from the
operating system. In practice, this is very rare; people just call `malloc()`.

In Unix, that syscall is `brk()` (or `sbrk()`). The behavior of this call is a bit strange no

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q3600"></a>
### For string literals like `"Hello"`, are those stored on the stack or heap?

Neither.

Consider it to be stored in such a way that it is perpetually accessible from
the entire program for the entire run and is never freed. So sort of like the
heap.

This code is just fine:

```c
char *hello(void)
{
    char *s = "hello!";

    return s;
}
```

`s` is a local variable that is set to point to the string `"hello!"`, and `s`
is deallocated as soon as the function returns. But the data `s` points to
(namely the `"hello!"`) persists for the entire life of the program and is never
freed.

It's not actually on the heap, though. The C memory map looks like this,
typically:

```
+--------------------+
|       Stack        |
|         |          |
|         v          |
+- - - - - - - - - - +
|                    |
|                    |
|                    |
+- - - - - - - - - - +
|         ^          |
|         |          |
|        Heap        |
+--------------------+
| Uninitialized data |
+--------------------+
|  Initialized data  |
|    (Read-Write)    |
+--------------------+
|  Initialized data  |
|     (Read-Only)    |
+--------------------+
|    Program code    |
+--------------------+
```

Constant strings are found in the read-only initialized data section of memory.

If you try to write to one, your program will likely crash:

```c
char *s = "Hello!";

*s = 'B'; // segfault!
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q3700"></a>
### Is the C stack like the stack data structure?

Yup! It's used by C to allocate space for local variables when you call functions.

When you return from a function, all those local variables are popped off the
stack and thrown away. (Which is why local variables only last as long as the
function!)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q3800"></a>
### Is the C heap like a binary heap data structure?

No--it's just a name collision.

Just assume the heap is a big, contiguous chunk of memory. It can be used for
whatever, but in C, it is typically managed by `malloc()` and `free()` so that
we don't have to worry about it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q3900"></a>
### What are `stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr`?

These are the three files that are automatically opened for a process when it is first created.

| Stream          | File Name |  Device  |
| --------------- | :-------: | :------: |
| Standard Input  |  `stdin`  | Keyboard |
| Standard Output | `stdout`  |  Screen  |
| Standard Error  | `stderr`  |  Screen  |

`stderr` is typically used specifically for error messages, even though it goes
to the same place as `stdout`. (The idea is that you can redirect all normal
output to one place, and all error output to another place. Or suppress normal
output while allowing error output.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q4000"></a>
### How do I know which header files to `#include` for any particular function?

Check the man page for the function in question. It'll show it in the _Synopsis_
section.

Example for `printf()`:

> **SYNOPSIS**
> ```c
>    #include <stdio.h>
> ```
> ```c
>     int
>     printf(const char * restrict format, ...);
> ```

Note that if you type `man` on the command line for a particular function, you
might a manual page for another command that isn't the C function. In that case,
you have to specify the proper _section_ of the manual for the function.

Try section 3 for library functions, and section 2 for syscalls.

Example looking for `printf()` in section 3:

```shell
man 3 printf
```

And section 2 for the `mkdir()` syscall:

```shell
man 2 mkdir
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q4100"></a>
### When do I have to explicitly cast a type to another type?

Barely ever.

C is pretty good about conversions, and you should be able to build almost
everything without casting.

What if you need constant types?

```c
// Print a double:
// (Floating point constants are double by default.)
printf("%lf\n", 3.14);

// Print a float:
printf("%f\n", 3.14f);

// Print a long double
printf("%Lf\n", 3.14L);

// Print a long integer:
printf("%ld\n", 99L);

// Print a long long integer:
printf("%lld\n", 99LL);

// Produce a floating result of a calculation by making sure at least
// one of the operands is a float:
float sort_of_pi = 22.0f / 7;
double double_pi = 22.0 / 7;
```

What if you need to cast a void pointer?

```c
void foo(void *p)
{
    // convert p to a char*
    char *q = p;

    // Don't need to cast return value from malloc
    int *z = malloc(sizeof(int) * 100);
```

Some exceptions:

```c
void foo(int a)
{
    // Cast an unused variable to type void to suppress compiler warnings:
    (void)a;

    // If the compiler is warning about an unused return value:
    (void)printf("Hello, world!\n");

    // Cast to a char pointer to iterate over bytes of an object:
    // (C99 6.3.2.3 paragraph 7 allows this.)
    float f = 3.14;
    unsigned char *c = (unsigned char *)&f;

    for (unsigned i = 0; i < sizeof f; i++) {
        printf("%02x ", c[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q4200"></a>
### Is `realloc()` the same as calling `malloc()`, copying the data over, then calling `free()` on the original pointer?

Effectively, yes, it's the same. Practically, you should use `realloc()`.

`realloc()` might be more efficient because in some cases it might not have to
copy.

If you grow the space and `realloc()` knows there's extra unused memory right
after the existing space, it will simply tack that addition space onto the end
of the memory region and not bother moving the data.

Also, if you shrink the space, `realloc()` will likely not copy the data. It'll
just truncate it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q4300"></a>
### What happens if I `free()` a `NULL` pointer?

Nothing. It's a [no-op](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOP_(code)).

Basically, inside the library code for `free()`, there's something that looks
like this:

```c
void free(void *ptr)
{
    if (ptr == NULL) {
        return;
    }
```

According to the [C99
spec](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1124.pdf) section
7.20.3.2p2:

> The `free` function causes the space pointed to by `ptr `to be deallocated,
> that is, made available for further allocation. **If `ptr` is a null pointer,
> no action occurs**. Otherwise, if the argument does not match a pointer
> earlier returned by the `calloc`, `malloc`, or `realloc` function, or if the
> space has been deallocated by a call to `free` or `realloc`, the behavior is
> undefined.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### What are bits, bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, and all that?

A [_bit_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fGujzulsas) is a single `1` or `0`.
That's all the numbers it can represent.

A _nibble_ is 4 bits. It can represent numbers from `0b0000` to `0b1111` (binary
numbers), which is equivalen to `0` to `15` in decimal.

A _byte_ is 8 bits. It can represent numbers from `0b00000000` to `0b11111111`,
or `0` to `255` decimal. (Historically, bytes could be other numbers of bits,
but on all modern systems, it's always 8 bits. _Octet_ is another term for a
number that is specifically 8 bits long.)

A _kilobyte_ is 1024 bytes. (1024 is 2<sup>10</sup>.)

A _megabyte_ is 1024 kilobytes (1,048,576 bytes).

A _gigabyte_ is 1024 megabytes (1,073,741,824 bytes).

A _terabyte_ is 1024 gigabytes (1,099,511,627,776 bytes).

A _petabyte_ is 1024 terabytes (1,125,899,906,842,624 bytes).

If you're used to [SI unit
prefixes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#Prefixes),
you might be wondering why in computers _kilo_ means 1024 instead of 1000 like
it normally does. In short, it's for historic reasons. 1024 was close enough, so
computer programmers adopted the SI prefixes, albeit with a slightly different
value.

And that gets confusing. When I say _kilobyte_, do I mean 1000 bytes or 1024 bytes?

In almost every single case, _kilobyte_ means 1024 bytes. (Hard drive and SSD
sizes are sometimes an exception to this rule.)

To remove the ambiguity, you can use a [binary
prefix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_prefix), where you'd say _kibibyte_
if you specifically meant 1024 bytes.

That said, in conversation, if someone says _kilobyte_, odds are extremely high
they mean 1024 bytes, not 1000 bytes. _kibibyte_ is uncommonly used in
conversation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q4500"></a>
### In C, can we assume an `int` is 32 bits?

No.

You can assume an `int` is _at least_ 16 bits (2 bytes).

There is only one type that has a guaranteed size: `sizeof(char)` will always be
`1` byte. (Same for `unsigned char` and `signed char`.)

Never write code that hardcodes or assumes the size of anything other than
`char`. **Always** use `sizeof` to get the size.

There's a [great Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_data_types)
that lists the minimum sizes of the types. If you want your code to be portable
to other compilers and systems, choose a type with a minimum size that works for
the numbers you need to hold.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q4600"></a>
### What's the difference between `#include` with double quotes and `#include` with angle brackets?

In general, use double quotes for your own header files, and angle brackets for
built-in system header files like `<stdio.h>`.

When you `#include "foo.h"`, it looks for `foo.h` in the same directory as the
source file doing the including.

You can also use relative paths, and it'll look relative to the including source file:

```c
#include "../bar.h"
#include "somedir/baz.h"
```

When you `#include <frotz.h>`, it looks in the _system include directories_ for
the header file. This is where all the built-in header files are installed. On
Unix machines, this tends to be the `/usr/include` directory, but it depends on
the OS and compiler.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q4700"></a>
### Should I declare a pointer to a thing, or just declare the thing?

It depends on if you want a thing or not, or if you just want to point to
another, **already-existing** thing.

If there is not an already-existing thing, then making a pointer doesn't make
sense. There's no existing thing for it to point to.

This does not declare an `int`:

```c
int *p;
```

There's no `int` there. We have an `int` pointer, but it's uninitialized, so it
points to garbage and can't be used.

So the question to ask is, "Do I already have an existing thing that I can point
to? And if so, do I want to point to it?" If the answer to either is "no", then
don't use a pointer.

Example:

```c
int a = 12; // here's an existing thing
```

So the answer to the first part of the question is yes. And do we want a pointer
to it? Sure, why not?

```c
int *p = &a; // and there's a pointer to it
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q4800"></a>
### Is there a difference between `exit()` and `return`?

If you're in the `main()` function, then no.

If you're in any other function, then yes.

`exit()` always exits the running process, no matter where you call it from.

If you're in `main()`, `return` also exits the running process.

If you're in any other function, `return` just returns from that function.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q4900"></a>
### Why does `strcmp()` return `0` when strings match? Since `0` means "false" in C, that seems backwards.

`strcmp()` returns the _difference_ between two strings. If the strings are the
same, there is zero difference, so it returns zero.

This gives `strcmp()` a little extra power over just returning a boolean
true/false value.

For example, if you run this:

```c
strcmp("Antelope", "Buffalo");
```

it will return less-than zero because "Antelope" is alphabetically less than
"Buffalo".

So not only can it tell you if the strings are the same, it can tell you their
relative sort order. And that means you can pass it in as the comparator
function to the library built-in `qsort()` function.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### What is "undefined behavior" in C?

There are a number of things you're allowed to do in C where the compiler is
allowed to produce code that can have any indeterminate effect. It could work,
it could crash, it could sort of work, it could crash sometimes and not others,
it could crash on some machines and not others.

When you write code that does that, we say the code has _undefined behavior_.

[Wikipedia has a number of practical
examples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undefined_behavior), and if you look in
the [C99 Language Specification, Annex
J.2](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1124.pdf) you can get a
list of _all_ the things you can do that cause undefined behavior.

At Lambda, the most common things you can do to get UB is using bad pointer references.

* Accessing memory you've already `free()`d.
* Freeing memory more than once.
* Accessing an array off the end of its bounds.
* Dereferencing a pointer that points to garbage.
* Dereferencing a `NULL` pointer.
* Returning a pointer to a local variable and dereferencing that.

GCC with `-Wall -Wextra` should warn on a lot of these. This is why it's
_really_ important to fix all those warnings.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q5100"></a>
### When you free a pointer, does it get set to `NULL` automatically?

No.

Furthermore, `free()` can't do that even if it wanted to.

```c
int *p = malloc(100 * sizeof(int));

free(p);
```

When we call `free()`, it gets a _copy_ of the pointer we pass in. (**All**
functions **always** get _copies_ of **all** arguments you pass in.) As such,
`free()` could set its copy of `p` to `NULL`, but that doesn't affect our
original `p`.

`p` remains whatever value was in it until we set it to something else.

```c
int *p = malloc(100 * sizeof(int));

free(p);

p = NULL; // NOW p is NULL
```

(Note that it's [undefined behavior](#ub) to _dereference_ a pointer after
you've `free()`d it. But it's still OK to change that pointer's value.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q5200"></a>
### How do I write preprocessor macros with `#define`?

You've probably already seen simple cases of `#define` like this:

```c
#define antelopes 10

int main(void)
{
    printf("Antelopes: %d\n", antelopes); // prints 10
```

What's actually happening here is the _preprocessor_ runs through the code
before the compiler ever sees it. It manipulates the above code to read:

```c
int main(void)
{
    printf("Antelopes: %d\n", 10); // prints 10
```

and _then_ hands it off to the compiler. The compiler itself knows nothing about
`#define`.

These `#define` _macros_ can also accept parameters that make them behave like
functions in a way.

Example:

```c
#define square(x) x * x // Not quite Right. See below.

int main(void)
{
    printf("9 squared is %d\n", square(9));
```

Then the preprocessor generates this code for the compiler:

```c
int main(void)
{
    printf("9 squared is %d\n", 9 * 9);
```

It just substitutes the parameters in as-is.

Another example:

```c
#define square(x) x * x // Not quite Right. See below.

int main(void)
{
    printf("3 + 2 squared is %d\n", square(3 + 2));
```

Then the preprocessor generates this code for the compiler, merely substituting
in exactly what the dev entered as an argument:

```c
int main(void)
{
    printf("3 + 2 squared is %d\n", 3 + 2 * 3 + 2);
```

Except that prints `11`, when it should print `25` (3 + 2 is 5, and 5 squared is
25)! We have a bug!

Of course, this has to do with the order of operations. We wrote:

```c
3 + 2 * 3 + 2
```

when what we really wanted was:

```c
(3 + 2) * (3 + 2)
```

For this reason, you should **always** put extra parentheses around the macro
body, and around every parameter in the body:

```c
#define square(x) ((x) * (x))
```

And now the expansion of our line will be:

```c
((3 + 2) * (3 + 2))
```

That will work in all expected cases.

### What is an `undefined symbol` linker error?

This happens when you've called a function, and the _linker_ can't find it in
any of the source files or libraries that you're using.

Do you have a warning about an implicit function declaration from the compiler
before this error? If so, fix that first.

If not, it could be that you haven't specified all the source files needed on
the command line. If you have two sources `one.c` and `two.c`, and one calls
functions that are in the other, then you have to pass both into the compiler:

```
gcc -Wall -Wextra -o myexe one.c two.c
```

Alternately, is there a `Makefile` present? If so, the author of the software
probably intends for you to use that to build the project, rather than trying to
figure out the command line on your own.

Try just running:

```
make
```

and seeing if that works. Make will show you the command lines it's running to
make the build happen so that you don't have to.

The linker is part of the entire compilation system. Basically, the compiler
takes your C source files, makes sure they're syntactically correct, and turns
them into things called _object files_, one per source file. These object files
might refer to functions that they don't contain, like `printf()`, for example.

Then the linker takes all the object files and libraries and puts them together
into a single binary executable that you can run. It makes sure that all the
functions used are present in the files specified.

(Normally this whole process takes place behind the scenes and you don't have to
think about it. Sometimes Makefiles will generate object files that you might
see, e.g. `foo.o`. `.o` is the extension for object files on Unix, or `.obj` in
Windows.)

If the linker can't find a function in any of the object files or libraries, it
pukes out an error. It can't call a function if it can't find it.

In this example, the code calls a function `foobaz()`, but the linker can't find
that in any of the object files:

```
Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64:
  "_foobaz", referenced from:
      _main in foo-133c47.o
ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
```

(Ignore the leading underscores on the function names.)

To fix, we need to figure out which file `foobaz()` is defined in, and make sure
to pass that filename to the compiler when we build.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### How do I make my own header files and what do I put in them?

If you have a `.c` file and you want to be able to use functions, `#define`s, or
globals from that file in another file, you'll need to make a _header file_
(`.h` file) to hold the function prototypes, `#define`s, and references to any
globals.

Example:

```c
// square.c

long square(long x)
{
    return x * x;
}
```

If you want to use `square()` from a different file, you need a way for that
file to know the `square()` function declaration so the compiler can check to
see that you're using it correctly.

For that, we need a corresponding `.h` file:

```c
// square.h

#ifndef SQUARE_H // Prevent multiple #includes
#define SQUARE_H

// Function prototypes
extern long square(long x);

#endif
```

The `#ifndef SQUARE_H` is called the _guard macro_, and is there to prevent the
header file from being included multiple times. (This can be a problem if you
have header files that include other header files in a cycle.) `#ifndef` means
"if not defined". Basically, `SQUARE_H` is acting as a boolean that gets set the
first time through and so prevents the content of the header file from being
included again.

All header files have wrappers like that. The name of the preprocessor variable
is conventionally `FILENAME_H`, but could be anything as long as it's unique in
the project.

The keyword `extern` indicates to the compiler that the function in question is
not defined here; it is defined in another file. In this header file, `extern`
is the default _storage class_ for functions, so it's redundant. But it's really
common to see in any case.

Now that we have a header file, we can `#include` that from somewhere else. Use
double quotes in the `#include` to indicate that the compiler should look in the
current directory for the header file.

```c
#include "square.h"

int main(void)
{
    int x = square(5);
```

When you build, you must specify all `.c` files on the command line:

```
gcc -Wall -Wextra -o main main.c square.c
```

### How do I make my own Makefile?

**IMPORTANT: Any lines shown _indented_ in any Makefile _must_ begin with a
single TAB character! Spaces will _not_ work. If you use spaces to indent,
you'll likely see a `Missing separator` error when you try to `make`.**

```make
myexecutable: mysource1.c mysource2.c
    gcc -Wall -Wextra -o myexecutable mysource1.c mysource2.c
```

The above Makefile says:

"If `mysource1.c` or `mysource2.c` are _newer_ than `myexecutable`, then run the
following commands in the indented block below this line."

And by "newer", we mean they have a more up-to-date timestamp, i.e. they've been
saved more recently than `myexecutable` has been created.

If any of the sources are newer than the executable, the executable should be
rebuilt to get it up to date. And that's what make does.

We say that `myexecutable` _depends on_ `mysource1.c` and `mysource2.c`. If
either of those dependencies change, `myexecutable` must be rebuilt.

This also works:

```make
myexecutable: mysource1.c mysource2.c
    gcc -Wall -Wextra -o $@ $^
```

`$@` is a make _macro_ that means "substitute whatever is left of the `:` right
here" (in this example, `myexecutable`).

`$^` is a make macro that means "substitute whatever is to the right of the `:`
right here" (in this example, `mysource1.c mysource2.c`).

You can also define constants:

```make
SRCS=mysource1.c mysource2.c
TARGET=myexecutable

$(TARGET): $(SRCS)
    gcc -Wall -Wextra -o $@ $^
```

You can have multiple _recipes_ per Makefile:

```make
target1: source1.c
    gcc -Wall -Wextra -o $@ $^

target2: source2.c
    gcc -Wall -Wextra -o $@ $^
```

If you type `make`, it will build the first _target_ in the file by default. A
target is a file that is generated by running `make`, i.e. a file to the left of
a `:`. You can also make specific targets by specifying them on the command line:

```shell
$ make target1
gcc -Wall -Wextra -o target1 source1.c
$ make target2
gcc -Wall -Wextra -o target2 source2.c
```

If you want all targets to get built by default, you can put a dummy first
target in that depends on the other targets. This target is called `all` by
convention. It typically doesn't run any commands and is only there to set up
the dependency hierarchy with the other recipes.

```make
# Recipe `all` depends on `target1` and `target2`:
all: target1 target2

target1: source1.c
    gcc -Wall -Wextra -o $@ $^

target2: source2.c
    gcc -Wall -Wextra -o $@ $^

.PHONY: all
```

That `.PHONY: all` line is a GNU make extension that indicates that `all` is not
a real file. Normally targets refer to real files, and make will check to see if
that file exists on disk or not before trying to build it. But in this case,
`all` is not a file; it's just recipe we're using to get all targets to build by
default.

### Why are there so many `printf()` variants? How do I know which one to use?

The way to approach it is when you think, "I need something just like
`printf()`, except instead of to the screen, it prints to _x_," then you look in
the man page and see if there's a `printf()` variant that suits your needs.

The first letters let you know what speciality each one has:

* `printf()`: stock, no frills.
* `fprintf()`: "file printf"; print to a specified `FILE*` instead of to `stdout`.
* `sprintf()`: "string printf"; print to a string instead of to `stdout`.
* `snprintf()`: "string printf, with a limited count"; print to a string instead
  of to `stdout`, and also specify the maximum number of characters that
  `snprintf()` is allowed to store in the buffer. This is good to protect
  against buffer overruns, and there's a valid argument that you should _never_
  use `sprintf()`, preferring `snprintf()` instead.
* `vprintf()`: "variadic printf"; anything that starts with a `v` in `printf`
  land has to do with [variadic
  functions](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Variadic-Functions.html),
  i.e. functions with argument lists of variable lengths. These are out of scope
  at Lambda.
* etc.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Why is `main()` always at the bottom of the file?

C has the feature that you have to _declare_ a function before you can use it.
So any functions `main()` needs have to be declared before `main()`, which means
"above" it in the file.

You can also declare functions with _prototypes_ and then put the definition of
`main()` before the definition of the other functions.

It's more common for C devs to put `main()` at the bottom of the file that
contains it, and C devs expect it that way, but it's not wrong or frowned upon
to use prototypes to put it at the top instead.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q5800"></a>
### Why does `main()` return `0`? What does the return value mean?

It doesn't _have_ to. The return value from `main()` is the _exit status_ of the
process. This is passed back to the program that first launched your program, so
it can do different things based on the exit status of your program.

Think of it like a way for an exiting program to pass a small piece of
information (an integer) back to the program that spawned it.

`0` by convention means "success". Non-zero means "failure". The idea there is
that there's typically only one way for a program to succeed, but many ways for
it to fail, and you can communicate those different ways with different exit
codes.

Note that you can also use the `exit()` call, passing an exit status code to it
as an argument. Using `return` in `main()` is equivalent to calling `exit()`.

In bash, you can look at the exit status of the previous command by `echo`ing
the `$?` shell variable. In the following example, we use `grep` incorrectly,
and it exits with status `2` to indicate that. Whereas we use `ls` correctly,
and it exits with successful status `0`:

```shell
$ grep
usage: grep [-abcDEFGHhIiJLlmnOoqRSsUVvwxZ] [-A num] [-B num] [-C[num]]
  [-e pattern] [-f file] [--binary-files=value] [--color=when]
  [--context[=num]] [--directories=action] [--label] [--line-buffered]
  [--null] [pattern] [file ...]
$ echo $?
2
$ ls -d .
.
$ echo $?
0
```

At the OS level, `fork()` is used to create a new process, and `wait()` is used
to get the exit status back from that process.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q5900"></a>
### Do we have to have a `main()`? Can there be more than one?

Only if you want to have a program that you can run. When you first launch a
program, it looks for a function called `main`.

There can only be one `main()` in a program. (There can only be one of any
function, for that matter.)

It could be that individual files don't have a `main()` in them, but when the
whole project it built, `main()` is brought in from another source file.

Also, there's a thing called a
[library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)) which is a
collection of functionality that your program makes use of, but doesn't have a
`main()`, itself. Your program has the `main()`, and it just _calls_ routines
that are in the library.

[The C Standard Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library) is a
library that holds all the standard C functionality (e.g. `printf()`, `sqrt()`,
etc.) but doesn't have a `main()` of its own. Other programs simply use the
library.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q6000"></a>
### Can `main()` return `void`? What about `main()` with no parameters?

No. The function signature for `main()` must be one of the following:

```c
int main(void)
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
int main(int argc, char **argv)
```

Note that the second two are equivalent. Use the first form if you don't need to
process command line arguments.

Historically, these were also equivalent, but the second form is now obsolete:

```c
int main(void)  // OK
int main()      // Obsolete
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q6100"></a>
### Do we need a semicolon at the end of every line?

Yes.

Or, more technically, at the end of every statement or expression.

C won't fill them in automatically like JavaScript will.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q6200"></a>
### Can a pointer point to more than one thing? What about to arrays and `struct`s?

A pointer is a memory address. A single memory address, a single index number
into your memory array.

As such, it can only point to a single byte in memory.

For single-byte and multi-byte entities, the pointer _always points to the first
first byte of that entity_.

If you have an `int` made up of 4 bytes, a pointer to that `int` points to the
address in memory of the first byte of that `int`.

If you have a `struct`, it points to the first byte of that `struct`.

If you have an array of a zillion `struct`s, it points to the first byte of the
0th `struct` in that array.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="q6300"></a>
### If variables are stored in memory, where are pointers stored?

Pointers themselves are variables.

Variables are stored in memory.

Therefore pointers are also stored in memory.

Remember that a pointer is just an index into memory. It's just a number; in
fact it's an integer number. We can store integer numbers in memory without a
hassle.

The only difference between a pointer and an integer is that you can dereference
the pointer to see what it's pointing to. You can't dereference an integer. In
memory, they're both just stored as numbers.

# Functions in C

Functions in C are not much different from functions in JavaScript. Probably the most notable difference, at least from a syntactic point of view, is that you need to specify types on all your variables and input parameters, along with needing to specify the return type of the function. Remember, C is a _strongly_ typed language, as opposed to JavaScript which is a _loosely_ typed language where types are entirely inferred by the interpreter. The C compiler ensures that you specify your types and that your code is consistent with the types you specify. 

Here is a non-comprehensive list of C data types: [https://codeforwin.org/2015/05/list-of-all-format-specifiers-in-c-programming.html](https://codeforwin.org/2015/05/list-of-all-format-specifiers-in-c-programming.html)

To reiterate, you might declare a function in C like this:
```c
    int foo(int param1, int param2)
    {
        ...
        return 0;
    }
```
This function signature states that it receives two integer parameters and returns an integer. 

Here's another example:
```c
    void bar(int[])
    {
        ...
    }
```
This function signature states that it receives a single integer array and doesn't return anything. You'll often see this kind of function signature when you want the function to simply mutate the input and/or print the contents of the input.

For printing output, you'll want to use the `printf` function, which is included in the `stdlib` library. 

## Implementing fizzbuzz

Your first task is going to be writing good ol' fizzbuzz in C! Your `fizzbuzz` function should receive some integer n, then loop up till n, printing out "Fizz" if the current iteration i is divisible by 3, "Buzz" if it's divisible by 5, or "FizzBuzz" if it is divisible by both 3 and 5. Additionally, for each iteration where nothing is printed, your function should increment a counter and return the result of that counter at the end of its execution. 

Navigate to the `fizzbuzz.c` file. You'll write your code in there. When you want to test it, type `make tests` into your terminal (make sure you're doing this from the directory where the `Makefile` is located), which will run the `Makefile` and compile your program and, if the compilation was successful, run the tests for it as well.

# Hangman

## Objective
Write a program that allows you play a game of Hangman. All of your code can be written in the `hangman.c` file. 

## How your Program Should Work
The main loop of the program prints the current state of the game and then waits for input from the player. When the player types in input (either a single letter guess or a word guess), the game checks if the letter is one that is in the target word or if the word guess matches the target word. If the guess is correct, the game state updates accordingly by revealing the guess as part of the target word. If the guess is incorrect, the game state updates accordingly by showing that letter in the 'incorrect guesses' list and adding another limb to the hangman drawing. 

You'll compile your program with 
```
gcc -o hangman hangman.c
```
This will create an executable called `hangman` that you'll execute with the command `./hangman` once you've successfully compiled the program. 

For this implementation, your program should receive a single word parameter; that will be the word that the player is trying to guess. So running your program might look like this
```
./hangman antidisestablishmentarianism
```
This will start the game loop, which will then continue running until the player wins, the player loses, or the player exits the game. 

## How to Tackle the Problem
This problem can be broken down into many subproblems. Each subproblem can be further broken down into chunks that you can think about how to implement in code. These include, but are not limited to, the following:
 - [ ] Reading input from the user and recording it properly
    - [ ] Figuring out how to parse command line arguments 
 - [ ] Properly recording game state
    - [ ] Keeping track of all letters/words that have been inputted
    - [ ] Recording the incorrect guesses
 - [ ] Printing the proper UI given the game's current state
 - [ ] Implementing the ability to accept both single letter guesses as well as entire word guesses
    - [ ] Having the game UI respond appropriately when a player makes a correct / incorrect guess
 - [ ] Adding the ability for the user to exit the game by typing in the proper keyword

## Rules of Hangman
Just in case you happen to be someone who _doesn't_ know the rules of Hangman, we'll list them here.

The game has you guess a word. You're given 8 strikes. If you guess an incorrect letter (that you haven't already guessed before), or take a stab at guessing the entire word and don't get the correct word, that's one strike. The game keeps track of each letter that you've guessed. You win the game when you guess the correct word.

# Dynamic Memory

Remember that a few modules ago when we were talking about arrays in C being entirely static? That's a pretty big limitation since we're forced to know up front what kind of data we want to store in the array and how much data there is before we can fit it into an array. We aren't psychics here. How do we get around this?

The answer to that is the `malloc` function. Its signature is this:
```c
    void *malloc(size_t size);
```
A `size_t` type is nothing more than a really large int for representing large sizes. The other thing to note is that the `malloc` function returns a `void` pointer. The `void` type simply means the type could be anything; essentially, we don't know the type up front. So `malloc` returns us a pointer of unspecified type that points to a chunk of memory with the specified size.

Well, if there's this `void` type, what's to stop us from just declaring everything as a `void` type? The drawback to the `void` type is that the compiler then can't infer much of anything about the data that a void pointer points to. It can't determine how much data a `void` pointer is pointing to, plus `void` pointers cannot be dereferenced until they are _cast_ (their type is changed) to a known type. Basically, it won't be able to provide us nearly as many compile-time protections as it can if we have all of our types declared. The moral of the story is that the `void` type should only be used when you actually do not know the type of the data up front. `malloc` returning a `void` pointer is a great use-case for this.

Here are some pretty typical `malloc` calls:
```c
    int *100_ints = malloc(100 * sizeof(int));

    char *50_chars = malloc(51);
```
The first `malloc` call allocates enough space for 100 ints. The `malloc` call initially returns a `void` pointer, but it then gets _cast_ to an `int` pointer on the left-hand side. You'll also note that we're using the `sizeof` operator in order to find the size of an individual integer, and then multiplying by the number of integers we're looking to store in order to get the total amount of memory we need. We have to do this because integers are not stored in a single byte, and integer sizes may fluctuate from platform to platform.

With the second `malloc` call, you'll see we don't do that. We're still performing the cast to a `char` pointer, but there's no call to the `sizeof` operator. This is because `char`s each fit within a single byte, so 51 bytes will hold 51 `char`s, which is exactly what we want. Once we have a pointer to the `malloc`'d memory, we can work with it exactly how we've been working with pointers. 

So, we still need to know how much data we want to fit inside this chunk of `malloc`'d memory, which still isn't all that helpful since that's still a hefty limitation. There exist other library functions, such as `realloc`, which can receive a pointer to `malloc`d memory and then resize that chunk of memory, but for this module we're just going to stick with `malloc`. 

We'll talk about one of the main usages of `malloc` in the next module.

## Working with Void Pointers Directly

Getting a void pointer back from a `malloc` call isn't the only time we'll need to deal with void pointers. Sometimes we'll need to explicitly cast a void pointer that's already referring some data, unlike the chunk of memory we're getting back from `malloc` call, which starts off empty and uninitialized. 

A common use-case for void pointers is when we want to write a function that is generic over types, i.e., it doesn't care what the types of its inputs are. Let's assume we have the following function signature:

```c
void foo(void *a, void *b);
```

Here, `foo` takes two void pointers, which will contain some data of a certain type, but `foo` either doesn't know what those types are or doesn't care. If we want to do something with these two void pointers though, we'll have to explicitly cast them to some actual type we can work with. We can do that like this:

```c
char *cast_a = (char *) a;
char *cast_b = (char *) b;
```

Here we cast both void pointers to be char pointers. Note that this doesn't actually transform the data these two pointers point to, we aren't changing the underlying data's type. We just need to temporarily assign a concrete type to these pointers so that we can do something with them inside our `foo` function. 

We pick `char *`s here because the `char` type is guaranteed by the C specification to be one byte each. This is desirable because it's the most granular type we can pick. If we're going to be touching some memory and not treating as the type that it actually is, then to avoid any sort of memory corruption, we want to be as granular as possible when handling that underlying data, hence the usage or chars and not some other type.

# Pointers

From the perspective of C, your entire computer is nothing more than a giant array of memory into which values can be written. Given this analogy, when we're dealing with arrays, how do we access some value stored inside of said array? 

We do it with indices that point to a specific spot in the array. As it turns out, pointers in C are simply just that: indices into the giant array of memory that is your computer. More formally, a pointer is a memory address that tells the program where to go and find some variable value. 

Those funky asterisks you might have seen already indicate a pointer (you might have heard them referred to as _references_ in other languages). Let's look at the function signature we had for the `reverse_string` function you wrote in the `strings` module:
```c
char *reverse_string(char s[])
{
    ...
}
```
The `char *` that is in the spot where the return type of the function usually goes is saying that this function will return a pointer to an array of characters.

It turns out that pointers and arrays in C are very much interconnected, so much so that it's pretty difficult to separate the topic of pointers from arrays. Every pointer points to the first spot of a contiguous portion of memory, and as we've already established, C pretty much just treats your computer as a giant array of memory. 

Indeed, there are many similarities between how you work with arrays and how you work with pointers. However, let's first talk about the _differences_ between them.

## Differences between arrays and pointers

Even though C let's you work with pointers and arrays in many of the same ways, don't think of them as synonomous. C's `sizeof` operator allows us to find the size of something in bytes. Let's say for example we had the following array:
```c
    int integers[] = { 9, 49, 1, 6, 10, 15 };
```
Calling `sizeof(integers)` gets us the total amount of data in the array. Then let's say we had a pointer to the same chunk of data:
```c
    int *pointer_to_integers = integers;
```
So we have an array named `integers` and a pointer called `pointer_to_integers` that points to the same spot in memory where the `integers` array is stored. If we were to call `sizeof(pointer_to_integers)`, we would actually get back the size of the pointer, not the size of the data it's pointing to.

There are a few other such sorts of edge cases, but for the most part they're pretty nuanced. So while, again, you shouldn't be thinking of pointers being arrays and vice versa, you would interface with them in many of the same ways. 

## Declaring pointers 

As showcased above, declaring a pointer is as simple as putting an asterisk after the type declaration of a variable. This signifies that we have a pointer to the declared type with the specified name. 

```c
/* Declaring two ints x and y, and an int array z */
int x = 1, y = 2, z[10];
int *ip;        /* ip is a pointer to an int */

ip = &x;        /* ip now points to x */
y = *ip;        /* y is now 1 */
*ip = 0;        /* x is now 0 */
ip = &z[0];     /* ip now points to z[0] */
```

There's nothing new going on in the first two lines of this block. Starting at the third line with `ip = &x;`, we see the `&` operator. This means we're grabbing the _address_ of the variable `x`, or in other words, we're asking for the address where the value of `x` (`1` in this case) is being stored. We do this because `ip` is a pointer, which stores an address, not a value. If we did `ip = x;`, that would be saying "store the value of the variable x in the variable `ip`", which would not compile since we've declared `ip` to be an integer pointer, not an integer value. 

In the next line, `y = *ip`, note that when we use the `*` operator not in a declaration, it signifies that we're want to grab the _value_ of the operand. So we're saying "set the variable `y` to be the value of the pointer `ip`". Again, since `ip` is a pointer, it stores an address. When we prepend the `*` operator in front of a pointer, we're asking for the value that that pointer points to. Put another way, we're indexing into the giant array of memory that is our computer and asking for the value at the given index. 

Next we have `*ip = 0;`. Here we're setting the value that `ip` points at to be 0. Before this, `ip` pointed to whatever `x`'s value was, because of the line `ip = &x;`. So now that we changed the value at some address, any other variables or pointers that also referenced that same address also got changed! If we were to print out the value of the `x` variable now, it would be `0`!

Lastly, we have `ip = &z[0];`, which declaring that `ip` now points to the first element of the `z` array. Again, we use the `&` operator in order to grab the _address_, not the _value_, of `z[0]`, since `ip` is a pointer that stores an address. 

## Pointer Arithmetic

When we index into arrays in JavaScript, we can do things like:
```javascript
    const someArray = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        someArray[i] = array[i + 1];
    }
```
We can index into arrays by performing arithmetic on the index. With pointers in C, we can do the exact same thing!

Let's say we have a pointer to a string like so:
```c
    char *str = "Some string";
```
We can loop through the characters in this string by doing this:
```c
    while (*str != '\0') {
        printf("%c", *str);
        str++;
    }
```
This loop will print out each character in the string. Indeed, this loop is pretty much analogous to iterating through an array. More precisely though, on each iteration of this while loop, we're incrementing the spot the pointer points to by one. At the beginning of the loop, `*str` points to the first character in the string, `S`. Then, on the next iteration, it gets incremented and then prints out `o`. This keeps going until the pointer points to the null character, which terminates the loop. 

Armed with this knowledge regarding pointers and pointer arithmetic, we can rewrite the `reverse_string` function from the last module to use pointers instead of allocating additional memory for the reversed string. This has the added benefit of performing the reverse in-place.
```c
    void *reverse_string(char *s)
    {
        char temp;
        int n = string_length(s);

        for (int i = 0; i < n/2; i++) {
            temp = s[i];
            s[i] = s[n-i-1];
            s[n-i-1] = temp;
        }
    }
```

## Use cases of pointers

Lastly, let's talk a bit about why pointers are useful. The number 1 most important reason as to why pointers exists, the motivation for their invention in the first place, is that the C compiler needs every type to have a known size at compile time. This is a pretty big restriction, and it's one that comes with the territory of working in a strongly-typed language. 

But there's lots of data that we won't know the size of until runtime. What if we need to accept user input? How do we know the size of that input before the user even gives it to us? What if we need to add data to some data structure at runtime? These are all valid questions, and the workaround to them is pointers. 

We can not tell the compiler the size of certain types upfront, so what we do instead is use something of a known size to refer to things of unknown size. That is exactly what pointers are. They're a type with a known size that tells us how to access something of an unknown size. 

So whenever we need to hold something like a string or a data structure whose size depends on something that can only be known at runtime, you can bet such structures will be referred to by a pointer. 

A slightly related use case is passing by reference vs. passing by value when we're talking about passing parameters to functions. You've probably at least heard of these terms used in other languages. Passing by value means that we're passing a _copy_ of the value to a function as a parameter. This results in additional work and memory overhead, but means we have a fresh copy of the data to work with, which is desirable in certain scenarios. 

On the flip side, passing by reference means we're passing a pointer to the data. In other words, the function doesn't have access to the data itself, but it is able to find that data in memory via the passed-in pointer. There's no need to copy the data, but then that also means the function doesn't have exclusive access to the data either.

# Quicksort 

For this module, you're going to implement a quicksort function. Feel free to reference prior implementation(s) and simply transpose the code from one language to the other. Typically this is a good way to practice new languages you're trying to learn: by transposing code you've written from one language to another.

In case you haven't seen the quicksort algorithm before, here's a Python implementation that you can use as a reference:
```python
def quicksort(alist, begin=0, end=None):
  if end is None:
    end = len(alist) - 1
  if begin < end:
    pivot = partition(alist, begin, end)
    quicksort(alist, begin, pivot-1)
    quicksort(alist, pivot+1, end)

def partition(alist, begin, end):
  pivot = begin

  for i in range(begin+1, end+1):
    if alist[i] <= alist[begin]:
      pivot += 1
      alist[i], alist[pivot] = alist[pivot], alist[i]
  
  alist[pivot], alist[begin] = alist[begin], alist[pivot]

  return pivot
```
Keep in mind that since Python is a higher-level language than C, it provides language features and constructs that aren't available in C. For example, the swapping syntax in Python isn't going to work in C without some additional work. The `swap` that you implemented earlier in the  has been included in this directory in the `lib.h` header file though, so you can use it here to swap values within an array in-place. Another Python language feature that you can't replicate in C are the default function parameters.

Navigate to the `quicksort.c` file. Implement your quicksort algorithm, then type `make tests` to check if you have all the tests passing.

# Arrays in C

In C, arrays are nothing more than contiguous chunks in memory that store a _single_ type of data. Additionally, arrays are static in size, at least in their most basic form. That means that we'll typically need to know the size and/or the amount of data a particular array will be storing when we initialize it. Unlike in higher-level languages, we can't just simply declare an empty array and then start pushing elements onto it willy-nilly.

If we wanted to declare an array of integers, we might do it like so:
```c
    int int_array[] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 };
```
Note the syntax here. We need the square brackets after the array's name to indicate that it is an array to the compiler, and when we declare the initial values of the array, we surround them with curly braces, not square brackets. 

Another way we might declare an array is the following:
```c
    int another_int_array[20];
```
With this, we've declared a statically-sized integer array that has space for 20 integers. There's nothing in it initially, but we can now start populating it with integers (and only integers) up to it's specified capacity. 
```c
    int n = 20 / sizeof(int);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        another_int_array[i] = i;
    }
```
While we allocated 20 bytes worth of space into the array, keep in mind that a single integer actually takes up more than a single byte of space in memory. To get around this, we can use the `sizeof` operator to find out exactly how many bytes a single `int` occupies on your machine, and then divide the array capacity by that to get the actual number of integers that can fit inside the array.

If we try to add more integers than the array has capacity for, we'll get a segmentation fault error, which means we've tried to access memory we don't have permission to access. That's what happens when we go outside of an array's bounds. 

We'll talk later on about how to handle dynamically-sized data. 

# Strings in C

So what do arrays have to do with strings? Everything, as it turns out. Strings in C are actually nothing more than arrays of characters. In fact, when declaring a string, you might do it like this:
```c
    char[] = "Hello world!";
```
Under the hood, this declaration becomes
```c
    char[] = { 'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', ' ', 'w', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd', '!', '\0' };
```
The `\0` character at the end represents the null character; _every_ C string is terminated with one of these, and in fact, if you wanted to write a function to find the number of characters in a string, you'd basically just loop through the character array and increment a counter until you found the `\0` character. 

IMPORTANT NOTE: So far, every language you've worked in has not differentiated between single and double quotes. In C, these actually make a difference. Single quotes delineate a single character, while double quotes delineate string literals. So for example, `"a"` is a string literal complete with a terminating null character at the end of it, as opposed to `'a'` which is just the individual character. 

The compiler _will_ yell at you if you try to store multiple characters in single quotes.

# Structs

Another limitation that exists in C that we haven't brought up yet is the fact that arrays in C can only hold a single type of data. Being able to stick any type of data all into the same array is a feature that you probably take for granted coming from JavaScript. Well, you can't do that in C!

Enter structs. Structs are basically C's version of a poor man's object. We can store values of different types inside a struct, which is awesome, but we need to declare the types of the fields that the struct can hold up front. That being said, structs are instrumental when it comes to implementing data structures and more complex types in C. 

## Initializing structs

Let's look at a simple struct definition:

```c
    struct Cat {
        char *breed;
        char *color;
        int age;
    };
```
This declares the shape of the Cat struct. Now we'll need to create an instance of it if we want to want to actually use it. Well, what actually defines an instance of something?

In this case, an instance of a struct is some chunk of memory that has been initialized with the shape of said struct. So we'll need to allocate memory for our Cat struct. We can do that with this:

```c
    struct Cat *a_cat = malloc(sizeof(struct Cat));
```
So we're handed a pointer to a chunk of memory that holds exactly the right amount of data for a single instance of a Cat. We take that and cast it to a pointer with the type of `struct Cat` since that's the type that is being held in this chunk of memory. We'll also need to go and initialize the values of our Cat instance like so:

```c
    a_cat->breed = NULL;
    a_cat->color = NULL;
    a_cat->age = 0;
```
What's with these funky arrows? Coming from JavaScript, you're used to using dot notation for accessing members of an object. Structs are poor man's objects, so shouldn't dot notation work here?

The answer is that dot notation is a thing in C, but because in this case we have a _pointer_ to a struct, we need to perform a dereference first in order to get to the actual data the struct contains. That's what the arrow syntax does. It performs a dereference first and then accesses the struct member. 

Basically, you can think of it like this:
```c
    a_cat->breed == (*a_cat).breed
```

Allocating memory for structs is one of the most important functions that `malloc` serves. Keep in mind though that when we declare a struct, every type in the struct needs to have a known size. Looking at the Cat struct, `char *`s and `int`s all have a known size, so the entire size of the struct can be calculated. However, we don't know the sizes of the data that the `char *`s may be pointing to. 

Let's say we have a function called `name_cat` that will assign a Cat instance with a given input name. It might look like this:

```c
    void name_cat(struct Cat *cat, char *name)
    {
        int name_length = string_length(name);

        cat->name = malloc(name_length);
        string_copy(cat->name, name);
    }
```
That's right, we'll need to call `malloc` to allocate the appropriate amount of memory to the `cat->name` field, and then we can call `string_copy` in order to copy each character in the input `name` string to the memory that `cat->name` now points to. 

## Freeing memory

Yet another abstraction that you're used to from higher-level languages is the garbage collector. A garbage collector is typically part of a languages runtime, and its job is to clean up memory that is used up by your programs. 

For example, after you write some JS program that has a bunch of arrays and objects, what happens to the memory that was needed to order to hold those instances? In a high-level language, a garbage collector goes through and figures out that those arrays and objects are no longer being used. It then deallocates or frees up that memory so that it can be reused by other programs. You the programmer never needs to worry about cleaning up after yourself; it's all handled for you automatically!

C doesn't baby you around like that. It expects _you_ to handle the clean up like the grown up you are. Learning to clean up after yourself can get difficult when you're writing more advanced programs in C. For simple programs though, it can be as simple as calling the function `free` after you're done with some piece of `malloc`'d memory. 

The `free` function receives a pointer that points to a piece of `malloc`'d memory, and it deallocates it so that that memory may be re-used. As you can imagine, once some `malloc`'d memory has been `free`'d, whatever data was in that chunk of memory is gone, so make sure you're done with the data before `free`ing it!

Let's codify this into a simple heuristic that isn't too hard to memorize: 
> For every call to `malloc` there should be an accompanying call to `free`.

A couple of common errors that arise when it comes to `free`ing memory are:
1. Forgetting to call `free` on some `malloc`'d piece of memory. This is a problem because that memory doesn't get cleaned up, and you end up with what's called a 'memory leak'. A single memory leak isn't the end of the world, but if you continually forget to `free` your memory, they'll start to pile up and waste precious memory resources that could be used by other programs that actually need that memory. 
2. Calling `free` on a pointer to memory that has already been `free`'d. This is called a 'double free', and it should be avoided because it may corrupt the state of the memory manager (which is what keeps track of all of the pieces of memory that have been handed out so far), which might cause existing blocks of memory to get corrupted or for future allocations to fail in bizarre ways (for example, the same memory getting handed out on two different successive calls of malloc).

Going back to our Cat struct, we might want to have a `Cat_destroy` function that will handle the cleaning up of a Cat instance for us. It'll free all the memory that was allocated during the Cat instance's lifetime.

```c
    void Cat_destroy(struct Cat *cat)
    {
        if (cat->name != NULL) {
            free(cat->name);
        }

        if (cat->breed != NULL) {
            free(cat->breed);
        }

        if (cat != NULL) {
            free(cat);
        }
    }
```

## The `typedef` Keyword

In all the previous example code, we've had to prepend every type we created with `struct`. That's because `struct` is part of the newly-created type's name, and as of now, we can't leave it out whenever we're using one of our own artificial types. C provides the `typdef` keyword which will ultimately save us some keystrokes. It will allow us to not have to prepend `struct` to any of our created types. Here's how we use it:

```c
    typedef struct Cat {
        char *breed;
        char *color;
        int age;
    } Cat;
```

We'll add the `typedef` keyword in front of our type definition. Then, after the closing brace of our struct, we specify the aliased type we'd like for this user-created type to have. Here we'll just keep it the same as the name of the struct itself, though you could call it something else if you wanted to. 

Now, whenever we want to use our `Cat` type, we don't need to prepend `struct` in front of it. The compiler now knows that when we just specify `Cat` that we're referring to our `struct Cat` type definition. It's a one-time cost that we pay when we define our types, but it'll save us a lot of keystrokes later on, especially if we're using our types a lot!

## `runtests.sh: 4: Syntax error: word unexpected (expecting "do")`

_Chief. Windows_

If you see this error:

  ```
  Running unit tests:
  : not foundtests.sh: 2: ./tests/runtests.sh:
  ./tests/runtests.sh: 4: ./tests/runtests.sh: Syntax error: word unexpected (expecting "do")
  ```

  You have two options:

  1. Open the file `tests/runtests.sh` in VS Code in whatever subproject folder
     you're working in, e.g. `fizzbuzz`. Click on the lower right of the screen
     where it says `CRLF`. Choose `LF`. Save the file. Then the error should go
     away.

  2. You can do this from the command line with the `tr` command:

  ```
  cd tests
  cat runtests.sh | tr -d '\r' > runtests.tmp
  mv runtests.tmp runtests.sh
  ```

  The root of the problem is a setting in git that causes all newlines (LF) to
  be converted to carriage-return/newline (CRLF). The script `runtests.sh` is a
  _bash script_ that bash runs, and bash *hates* `\r` and pukes everywhere.

  To cause git to _not_ do newline conversion for future clones, run the
  following:

  ```
  git config --global core.autocrlf false
  ```

## Mac: `malformed object` error when running `make tests`

This is caused by an older version of the `ar` and `ranlib` packages being installed.
Sometimes these conflict with the versions installed with xcode.

If running MacPorts:

```
sudo port selfupdate
sudo port upgrade cctools
```

If running Brew:

```
sudo brew update
sudo brew upgrade gcc
```

# The _class_ Syntax

This challenge focuses on using the new for ES6 `class` syntax.

##### Index

* [Instructions](#instructions)
* [Get Started](#get-started)

## Instructions

Find the file `index.js` and complete the tasks until all of your tests pass.

**You can use yesterday's work to help you.** However, if you struggled a lot with that assignment, it is recommended that you attempt to re-write all code without "cheating" (peeking at yesterday's code or copy-pasting it).

**Plan to commit & push every time you get a new test passing!**. Committing often makes it SO much easier to figure out "what broke my code", and helps your TL keep track of how you're doing.

If you run into trouble while coding, fight the good fight for 20 minutes and then get on the help channel. __Remember to formulate your help request in a professional manner__ - like you would at the job - by including error messages, screenshots, and any other pertinent information about the problem, as well as what things you have attempted already while trying to solve it.

## Get Started

<summary><strong>Using VSCode and the Command Line:</strong></summary>

1. Fork repo and add TL as collaborator on Github.
1. Clone _your_ fork (not Lambda's repo by mistake!).
1. `cd` into your newly cloned repository.
1. Create a new branch by typing `git checkout -b <firstName-lastName>`.
1. Install dependencies by typing `npm install`.
1. Run tests by typing `npm run test:watch`.
1. Work on your branch, push commits and create PR as usual.

# Data Structures I

Topics:

 * Big-O Notation (Complexity analysis)
 * Stacks
 * Queues
 * Linked Lists
 * Hash Tables



#### Stacks

 * Should have the methods: `add`, `remove`, and a getter for the property `size`
 * `add` should accept a value and place it on top of the stack.
 * `remove` should remove and return the top value off of the stack.
 * `size` should return how many items are on the stack.

#### Queues

 * Should have the methods: `enqueue`, `dequeue`, and a getter for the property `size`
 * `enqueue` should add an item to the back of the queue.
 * `dequeue` should remove an item from the front of the queue.
 * `size` should return the number of items in the queue.

#### Linked Lists

 * Should have the methods: `addToTail`, `removeHead`, and `contains`.
 * `addToTail` replaces the tail with a new value that is passed in.
 * `removeHead` removes and returns the head node.
 * `contains` should searth through the linked list and return true if a matching value is found.
 * The `head` property is a reference to the first node and the `tail` property is a reference to the last node.  These are the only two properties that you need to keep track of an infinite number of nodes.  Build your nodes with objects.

#### Hash Tables

 * Should have the methods: `insert`, `remove`, and `retrieve`.
 * `insert` should take a key value pair and add the value to the hash table.
 * `retrieve` should return the value associated with a key.
 * `remove` should removed the given key's value from the hash table.
 * Should properly handle collisions.  If two keys map to the same index in the storage table then you should store a 2d array as the value.  Make each key/value pair its own array that is nested inside of the array stored at that index on the table.

### Extra Credit

 * Uncomment the final test in `hash-table.test.js` and make the hash-table rebalance.  As a hash table increases in size the associated storage table will typically double in size once it reaches a certain capacity. Change the hash table so that it doubles the size of the storage table once it is 75% full.
 * If you used arrays as your underlying data structure for implementing stacks, queues, and hash table buckets, convert these to use linked lists instead as the underlying data structure. If you started off with linked lists, convert these to use arrays. In order to do this, you'll need to export your linked list implementation by wrapping it inside a `module.exports`. Just comment out your initial implementation; don't delete perfectly good code!
 * Make your linked list implementation a [doubly linked list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_linked_list).

# Data Structures II

Topics:

 * Tree
 * Graph
 * Binary Search Tree


#### Trees

  * Should have the methods: `addChild`, and `contains`
  * Each node on the tree should have a `value` property and a `children` array.
  * `addChild(value)` should accept a value and add it to that node's `children` array.
  * `contains(value)` should return `true` if the tree or its children the given value.
  * When you add nodes to the `children` array use `new Tree(value)` to create the node.
  * You can instantiate the `Tree` class inside of itself.

#### Binary Search Tree

  * Should have the methods: `insert`, `contains`, `depthFirstForEach`, and `breadthFirstForEach`.
  * `insert(value)` inserts the new value at the correct location in the tree.
  * `contains(value)` searches the tree and returns `true` if the the tree contains the specified value.
  * `depthFirstForEach(cb)` should iterate over the tree using DFS and passes each node of the tree to the given callback function.
  * `breadthFirstForEach(cb)` should iterate over the tree using BFS and passes each node of the tree to the given callback function (hint: you'll need to either re-implement or import a queue data structure for this).

#### Graphs

  * Should have methods named `addNode`, `contains`, `removeNode`, `addEdge`, `getEdge`, and `removeEdge`
  * `addNode(newNode, toNode)` should add a new item to the graph.  If `toNode` is given then the new node should share an edge with an existing node `toNode`.
  * `contains(value)` should return true if the graph contains the given value.
  * `removeNode(value)` should remove the specified value from the graph.
  * `addEdge(fromNode, toNode)` should add an edge between the two specified nodes.
  * `getEdge(fromNode, toNode)` should return `true` if an edge exists between the two specified graph nodes.
  * `removeEdge(fromNode, toNode)` should remove the edge between the two specified nodes.


### Extra Credit

 * Add a method to the `Graph` class that searches through the graph using edges. Make this search first as a depth first search and then refactor to a breadth first search.
 * Read up on [heaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)) here. Then implement one!
 * Read up on [red-black trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree) here. Then implement one!






# Mongo II Mini

## Topics To Cover
* Schema Types
  * [String, Number, Buffer, Date, Boolean, Mixed, ObjectId, Array](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/schematypes.html)
* [$ne](https://docs.mongodb.com/v3.2/reference/operator/query/ne/)
* [$and](https://docs.mongodb.com/v3.2/reference/operator/query/and/index.html)
* [$or](https://docs.mongodb.com/v3.2/reference/operator/query/or/index.html)
* [$in](https://docs.mongodb.com/v3.2/reference/operator/query/in/#op._S_in)
* [$gt](https://docs.mongodb.com/v3.2/reference/operator/query/gt/)
* [$sum](https://docs.mongodb.com/v3.2/reference/operator/aggregation/sum/index.html)
* [$orderby](https://docs.mongodb.com/v3.2/reference/operator/meta/orderby/index.html)
* [count](https://docs.mongodb.com/v3.2/reference/command/count/index.html)


## Running the Project

* `cd` into your project directory.
* `npm install` to receive your dependencies.
* fire up your `mongod` server from your root dir or create a `data` dir in this project to store your documents from mongo there. `mongod --dbpath data`.

### Mongoose Schema
* When you open `models.js` you'll see we've already included your Schema. You're welcome. 
* You'll also notice that this project comes with a `people.json` file, and a `populateDbScript.js`. this script will grab those `people` and add them into your db as long as you have your mongo server up and running. 
* RUN: `node populateDbScript.js` get receive all your data.

### Todos:
* write a `GET` request to `/users` that simply returns all the people.
* write a `GET` request to `/users/:direction` that takes the given string and returns back a list of sorted data alphebetically.
  * hint direction can be `asc` or `desc` so in your `.sort()` method you'll have to conditionally check, and we are going to be sorting by user `firstName`
* write a `GET` request `/user-get-friends/:id` that returns a single users's friends.
### Extra Credit: 
* lastly write a `PUT` that updates a users `firstName` `lastName`

## Hints

#### Helpful tips & reminders 🔎

* **Critical:** Don't make assumptions about input data types. (Convert/handle `Numbers` & `null`)
    * Convert **number strings** into **actual numbers** with built-in functions `parseInt`, `parseFloat`, `Number`, etc.
* Ensure your functions **`return somethingUseful`.**
* Make sure you understand the requirements. All the words used? Try list the steps in comments first.
* Don't forget the source data uses `snake_case` naming.
* Pay close attention to array vs. object syntax (`vehicles[0].name` vs. `character.vehicles`.)
* Some of the functions include detailed instructions.
* You might have to infer the desired fields. Carefully read the description and function name (description included above the function.)

# Node-Express-Gmaps

Topics:
 * APIs
 * API Documentation
 * Rate Limits
 * Multiple requests

## Objectives
 * Create endpoints
 * Make multpile requests to third-party API
 * Return result

## Beginning Project
 * You will notice there is a config file that is ignored in the .gitignore, which you will be using to store your API key. You will need to import that key into your server file. DO NOT store it anywhere that will get pushed up to your repo.
 * Everything else you will start from scratch.

## Project Description
 * You will be using the Google Maps Place API to get details about any place provided by the user of your API. When the user provides you a query (example: `coffee+shops+in+Austin`) you will use that query to make a request to the `Place Search` service, and will specifically be doing a `Text Search Request`. You will use the necessary information from the data returned from that first request, and then do a request to `Place Details` service, returning the detailed information to the user of your API.

## Project Requirements
 * Create an endpoint `/place` that, provided a query, returns the detailed information about the first place that is in the array of places returned to you from `Place Search`.
 * You will be using the `node-fetch` library to make your requests to the `Place Search` API. You can use its example code in its github repo as guidance for its use.

## Stretch Problem
 * Create an endpoint `/places` that, provided a query returns the detailed information about ALL places returned to you from `Place Search`.

## Resources
 * Places API: https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/
 * Place Search: https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/search
 * Place Details: https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/details

# Day II

## Project Requirements
* Create an enpoint called `/travel/mode` that returns the quickest method of travel given two locations, as well as the travel time. It should account for driving, walking, bicycling, and transit.

## Project Notes
* You will need a separate key than what you've used for the Places API since it is actually a different API.
* For best results, try to pick locations that should indeed have transit available.

## Stretch Problem
* Include this comparison information in the information your return from `/place`.

# Overview
"Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods. A feature of objects is that an object's procedures can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated (objects have a notion of "this" or "self"). In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another.[1][2]" --Wikipedia

In English, this means that in OOP, code is organized in logical and self contained parts that contain within them everything needed to create, store, and manipulate one very specific element of the program.  When this element is needed, a copy of it is initialized according to the instructions within.  This is called an object.  

As with all things programming, the specific vocabulary varies from language to language, or even programmer to programmer.  Some Python vocabulary:

Class:  The top level organization structure in OOP.  This contains all of the instructions and storage for the operations of this part of the program.  A class should be self contained and all variables within the class should only be modified by methods within the class.

Method:  A function that belongs to a specific class.

Constructor:  A special method, defined with __init__() that is used to instantiate an object of this class.

Inheritance:  Perhaps the most important concept in OOP, a class may inherit from another class.  This gives the child class all of the variables and methods found in the parent class, or classes, automatically.  

Override:  If a child class needs to function slightly differently than objects of the parent class, this can be done by giving the child class a method with the same name as one found in the parent.  This method will override the one defined in the parent class.  Often, this is done to add child specific functionality to the method before calling the parent version of the method using super().foo().  This is commonly done with the __init__() method.

Self: In Python, a class refers to class-level variables and methods with the keyword `self`.  These have scope across the entire class.  Variables may also be declared normally and will have scope limited to the block of code they are declared within.

# Python OOP Toy
This project will demonstrate the core concepts of OOP by using a library called pygame to create a toy similar to early screensavers.  

For initial setup, run:

```
pipenv install
pipenv shell
```

Then to run, use: `python src/draw.py`

## In-class Demo
Your instructor will demonstrate the above concepts by extending the `Block` class

## Project Work
Fill out the stubs in `ball.py` to extend the functionality of the `ball` class.

## Stretch Goals
Implement simple physics to enable balls to bounce off of one another, or off of blocks.  This will be HARD.  If you get it 'sort of working' in any form, consider yourself to have accomplished an impressive feat!

## Troubleshooting

### Windows
* If `pipenv install` is taking forever or erroring with TIMEOUT messages, disable your antivirus software.
* If `pipenv install` is puking on installing pygame:
  * Don't use `pipenv` for this project. No `install`, no `shell`.
  * Download the appropriate `.whl` file from [here](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygame).
    * Python 3.6 use the `cp36` version. Python 3.7 use `cp37`, etc. Use `python --version` to check your version.
    * Try the `win32` version first. If that doesn't work, the AMD version.
    * E.g. `pygame‑1.9.3‑cp36‑cp36m‑win32.whl`
  * Install it with
    ```
    pip install pygame-[whatever].whl
    ```
    You'll need to specify the full path, likely.
  * Once it's installed, run the game from the `src/` directory with
    ```
    python draw.py
    ```
### Mac
* If you're getting errors about `InvalidMarker`:
  * Don't use `pipenv` for this project. No `install`, no `shell`.
  * Run `pip3 install pygame`
  * Once it's installed, run the game from the `src/` directory with
    ```
    python3 draw.py
    ```

# React-Todo

### Other Useful Resources
* [API Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html)
* [Documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html) on JSX

### Battle Plan
 * Objective: At this point you have become familiar with the DOM and have built out User Interfaces HTML and CSS and some custom components. Now we're going to dive into modern front-end JavaScript development by learning about ReactJS.
 * You're going to be building a ToDo App (please hold your applause).
 * We know this may seem trivial, but the best part about this assignment is that is shows off some of the strengths of React and you can also take it as far as want so don't hold back on being creative.

  * Tool requirements
    * [React Dev Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en) - *This is a MUST* you need to install this asap!
    * We have everything you need for your React Developer environment in this file. We went over this in the lecture video.

#### To Get Started
##### You'll need to make sure you have the following installed.
  * node and npm
  * `npm install` will pull in all the node_modules you need once you `cd` into the root directory of the project
  * `npm start` will start a development server on your localhost at port 3000.
  * `npm test` will run the tests that are included in the the project. Try to get as many of these passing as you can in the allotted time. 

#### How to Tackle this Project
Your job is to write the components to complete the Todo List application and getting as many of the tests to pass as you can. The tests are expecting that you have a TodoList component that renders a Todo component for each todo item. The requirements for your Todo List app is that it should have an input field that a user can type text into and submit data in the input field in order to create a new todo item. Aside from being able to add todos, you should be able to mark any todo in the list as 'complete'. In other words, a user should be able to click on any of the todos in the list and have a strikethrough go through the individual todo. This behavior should be toggle-able, i.e. a todo item that has a strikethrough through it should still be clickable in order to allow completed items to no longer be marked as 'completed'. Once you've finished your components, you'll need to have the root `App` component render your TodoList component. 

#### Tips to Keep in Mind
  * All components you implement should go in the `src/components` directory.
  * The components should be named `App.js`, `TodoList.js` and `Todo.js` (as those are the files being imported into the tests). 
  * Think of your application as an Application Tree. App is the parent, which controlls properties/data needed for the child components. This is how modern applications are built. They're modular, separate pieces of code called components that you 'compose' together to make your app. It's awesome!
  * Be sure to keep your todos in an array on state. Arrays are so awesome to work with.
  * When you need to iterate over a list and return React components out as elements, you'll need to include a "key" property on the element itself. `<ElementBeingRendered key={someValue} />`. Note: this is what react is doing under the hood, it needs to know how to access each element and they need to be unique so the React engine can do its thing. An example snippet that showcases this may look something like this:
  ```
  this.state.todos.map((todo, i) => <AnotherComponent key={i} todo={todo} />);
  ```
  Here, we're simply passing the index of each todo item as the key for the individual React component.
  * Feel free to structure your "todo" data however you'd like. i.e. strings, objects etc. 
  * React will give you warnings in the console that urge you to squash React Anti-Patterns. But if something is completely off, you'll get stack trace errors that will force your bundle to freeze up. You can look for these in the Chrome console.

#### Stretch Problems
  * Refactor each todo to be an object instead of a just a string. For example, `todo: {'text': 'Shop for food, 'completed': false}` and when a user clicks on a todo, switch that completed flag to true. If `completed === true`, this should toggle the strikethrough on the 'completed' todo. The toggling functionality should work the same as when each todo was just a string. 
  * Add the ability to delete a todo. The way this would work is each todo item should have an 'x' that should be clickable and that, when clicked, should remove the todo item from the state array, which will also remove it from the rendered list of todos. 
  * Take your App's styles to the next level. Start implementing as much creativity here as you'd like. You can build out your styles on a component-by-component basis eg `App.js` has a file next to it in the directory tree called `App.scss` and you define all your styles in that file. Be sure to @import these styles into the `index.scss` file. 
  * Persist your data in `window.localStorage()` hint: you may have to pass your data to a stringifier to get it to live inside the `localStorage()` of the browser. This will cause it to persist past the page refresh.

## What is a relational database?

Data stored as row records in tables. Imagine a spreadsheet with column
headers describing the contents of each column, and each row is a
record.

A database can contain many tables. A table can contain many rows. A row
can contain many columns.

Records are related to those in different tables through common columns
that are present in both tables.

For example, an `Employee` table might have the following columns in
each record:

    Employee
        EmployeeID  FirstName  LastName  DepartmentID

And a `Department` table might have the following columns in each
record:

    Department
        DepartmentID  DepartmentName

Notice that both `Employee` and `Department` have a `DepartmentID`
column. This common column *relates* the two tables and can be used to
*join* them together with a *query*.

The structure described by the table definitions is known as the
*schema*.

Compare to NoSQL databases that work with key/value pairs or are
document stores.

* [Relational Database at Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database)
* [Non-relational (NoSQL) databases at Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL)


## Relational vs NoSQL

*NoSQL* is a term that refers to non-relational databases, most usually
document store databases. (Though it can apply to almost any kind of
non-relational database.)

MongoDB is a great example of a NoSQL database.

### When Do You Use NoSQL Versus a Relational Database?

Unfortunately, there are no definitive rules on when to choose one or
the other.

Do you need ACID-compliance? Consider a relational database.

Does your schema (structure of data) change frequently? Consider NoSQL.

Does absolute consistency in your data matter, e.g. a bank, inventory
management system, employee management, academic records, etc.? Consider
a relational database.

Do you need easy-to-deploy high-availability? Consider NoSQL.

Do you need transactions to happen atomically? (The ability to update
multiple records simultaneously?) Consider a relational database.

Do you need read-only access to piles of data? Consider NoSQL.


## PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is a venerable relational database that is freely available
and world-class.

https://www.postgresql.org/

* **Assignment:** [Install PostgreSQL](#assignment-install-postgresql)


## SQL, Structured Query Language

SQL ("sequel") is the language that people use for interfacing with
relational databases.

### Create a table with CREATE TABLE

A database is made up of a number of tables. Let's create a table using
SQL in the shell. Be sure to end the command with a semicolon `;`.

(Note: SQL commands are often capitalized by convention, but can be
lowercase.)


    $ psql
    psql (10.1)
    Type "help" for help.

    dbname=> CREATE TABLE Employee (ID INT, LastName VARCHAR(20));

Use the `\dt` command to show which tables exist:

    dbname=> CREATE TABLE Employee (ID INT, LastName VARCHAR(20));
    CREATE TABLE
    dbname=> \dt
            List of relations
    Schema |   Name   | Type  | Owner 
    --------+----------+-------+-------
    public | employee | table | beej
    (1 row)

Use the `\d` command to see what columns a table has:

    dbname=> \d Employee
                            Table "public.employee"
        Column    |         Type          | Collation | Nullable | Default 
    --------------+-----------------------+-----------+----------+---------
     id           | integer               |           |          | 
     lastname     | character varying(20) |           |          | 

### Create a row with INSERT

    dbname=> INSERT INTO Employee (ID, LastName) VALUES (10, 'Tanngnjostr');
    INSERT 0 1

You can omit the column names if you're putting data in every column:

    dbname=> INSERT INTO Employee VALUES (10, 'Tanngnjostr');
    INSERT 0 1

Run some more inserts into the table:

```sql
INSERT INTO Employee VALUES (11, 'Alice');
INSERT INTO Employee VALUES (12, 'Bob');
INSERT INTO Employee VALUES (13, 'Charlie');
INSERT INTO Employee VALUES (14, 'Dave');
INSERT INTO Employee VALUES (15, 'Eve');
```

### Read rows with SELECT

You can query the table with `SELECT`.

Query all the rows and columnts:

    dbname=> SELECT * FROM Employee;
     id |  lastname   
    ----+-------------
     10 | Tanngnjostr
     11 | Alice
     12 | Bob
     13 | Charlie
     14 | Dave
     15 | Eve
    (6 rows)

With `SELECT`, `*` means "all columns".

You can choose specific columns:

    dbname=> SELECT LastName FROM Employee;
      lastname   
    -------------
     Tanngnjostr
     Alice
     Bob
     Charlie
     Dave
     Eve
    (6 rows)

And you can search for specific rows with the `WHERE` clause:

    dbname=> SELECT * FROM Employee WHERE ID=12;
     id | lastname 
    ----+----------
     12 | Bob
    (1 row)

    dbname=> SELECT * FROM Employee WHERE ID=14 OR LastName='Bob';
     id | lastname 
    ----+----------
     12 | Bob
     14 | Dave
    (2 rows)

Finally, you can rename the output columns, if you wish:

```sql
SELECT id AS Employee ID, LastName AS Name
    FROM Employee
    WHERE ID=14 OR LastName='Bob';
    
 Employee ID | Name 
-------------+----------
     12      | Bob
     14      | Dave
```

### Update rows with UPDATE

The `UPDATE` command can update one or many rows. Restrict which rows
are updated with a `WHERE` clause.`

    dbname=> UPDATE Employee SET LastName='Harvey' WHERE ID=10;
    UPDATE 1

    dbname=> SELECT * FROM Employee WHERE ID=10;
     id | lastname 
    ----+----------
     10 | Harvey
    (1 row)

You can update multiple columns at once:

    dbname=> UPDATE Employee SET LastName='Octothorpe', ID=99 WHERE ID=14;
    UPDATE 1


### Delete rows with DELETE

Delete from a table with the `DELETE` command. Use a `WHERE` clause to
restrict the delete.

**CAUTION!** If you don't use a `WHERE` clause, all rows will be deleted
from the table!

Delete some rows:

    dbname=> DELETE FROM Employee WHERE ID >= 15;
    DELETE 2

Delete **ALL** rows (*Danger, Will Robinson!*):

    dbname=> DELETE FROM Employee;
    DELETE 4

### Deleting entire tables with DROP

If you want to get rid of an entire table, use `DROP`.

**WARNING!** There is no going back. Table will be completely blown
away. Destroyed ...by the Empire.

    dbname=> DROP TABLE Employee;
    DROP TABLE

* **Assignment:** [Create a Table and Use It](#assignment-create-a-table-and-use-it)
  

## The `WHERE` Clause

You've already seen some examples of how `WHERE` affects `SELECT`,
`UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.

Normal operators like `<`, `>`, `=`, `<=`, `>=` are available.

For example:

```sql
SELECT * from animals
    WHERE age >= 10;
```

### `AND`, `OR`, and Parentheses

You can add more boolean logic with `AND`, `OR`, and affect precedence
with parentheses:

```sql
SELECT * from animals
    WHERE age >= 10 AND type = 'goat';
```

```sql
SELECT * from animals
    WHERE age >= 10 AND (type = 'goat' OR type = 'antelope');
```

### `LIKE`

The `LIKE` operator can be used to do pattern matching.

```sql
_   -- Match any single character
%   -- Match any sequence of characters
```

To select all animals that start with `ab`:

```sql
SELECT * from animal
    WHERE name LIKE 'ab%';
```


## Column Data Types

You probably noticed a few data types we specified with `CREATE TABLE`,
above. PostgreSQL has [a lot of data
types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/datatype.html).

This is an incomplete list of some of the more common types:

```sql
VARCHAR(n)   -- Variable character string of max length n
BOOLEAN      -- TRUE or FALSE
INTEGER      -- Integer value
INT          -- Same as INTEGER
DECIMAL(p,s) -- Decimal number with p digits of precision
             -- and s digits right of the decimal point
REAL         -- Floating point number
DATE         -- Holds a date
TIME         -- Holds a time
TIMESTAMP    -- Holds an instant of time (date and time)
BLOB         -- Binary object
```

## ACID and CRUD

These are two common database terms.

### ACID

Short for *Atomicity*, *Consistency*, *Isolation*, *Durability*. When
people mention "ACID-compliance", they're generally talking about the
ability of the database to accurately record transactions in the case of
crash or power failure.

Atomicity: all transactions will be "all or nothing".

Consistency: all transactions will leave the database in a consistent
state with all its defined rules and constraints.

Isonlation: the results of concurrent transactions is the same as if
those transactions had been executed sequentially.

Durability: Once a transaction is committed, it will remain committed,
despite crashes, power outages, snow, and sleet.

### CRUD

Short for *Create*, *Read*, *Update*, *Delete*. Describes the four basic
functions of a data store.

In a relational database, these functions are handled by `INSERT`,
`SELECT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.


## NULL and NOT NULL

Columns in records can sometimes have no data, referred to by the
special keyword as `NULL`. Sometimes it makes sense to have NULL
columns, and sometimes it doesn't.

If you explicitly want to disallow NULL columns in your table, you can
create the columns with the `NOT NULL` constraint:

    CREATE TABLE Employee (
        ID INT NOT NULL,
        LastName VARCHAR(20));


## COUNT

You can select a count of items in question with the `COUNT` operator.

For example, count the rows filtered by the `WHERE` clause:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Animals WHERE legcount >= 4;

 count 
-------
     5
```

Useful with [`GROUP BY`](#group-by), below.


## ORDER BY

`ORDER BY` which sorts `SELECT` results for you. Use `DESC` to sort in
reverse order.

```sql
SELECT * FROM Pets
ORDER BY age DESC;

  name     | age 
-----------+-----
 Rover     |   9
 Zaphod    |   4
 Mittens   |   3
```


## GROUP BY

When used with an aggregating function like [`COUNT`](#count), can be
used to produce groups of results.

Count all the customers in certain countries:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
    FROM Customers
    GROUP BY Country;

  COUNT(CustomerID)   |  Country 
----------------------+-----------
      1123            |    USA
       734            |    Germany
                     etc.
```


## Keys: Primary, Foreign, and Composite

### Primary Key

Rows in a table often have one column that is called the *primary key*.
The value in this column applies to all the rest of the data in the
record. For example, an `EmployeeID` would be a great primary key,
assuming the rest of the record held employee information.

    Employee
        ID (Primary Key)  LastName  FirstName  DepartmentID

To create a table and specify the primary key, use the `NOT NULL` and
`PRIMARY KEY` constraints:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employee (
    ID INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    LastName VARCHAR(20),
    FirstName VARCHAR(20),
    DepartmentID INT);
```

You can always search quickly by primary key.

### Foreign Keys

If a key refers to a primary key in another table, it is called a
*foreign key* (abbreviated "FK"). You are not allowed to make changes to
the database that would cause the foreign key to refer to a non-existent
record.

The database uses this to maintain *referential integrity*.

Create a foreign key using the `REFERENCES` constraint. It specifies the
remote table and column the key refers to.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Department (
    ID INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(20));

CREATE TABLE Employee (
    ID INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    LastName VARCHAR(20),
    FirstName VARCHAR(20),
    DepartmentID INT REFERENCES Department(ID));
```

In the above example, you cannot add a row to `Employee` until that
`DepartmentID` already exists in `Department`'s `ID`.

Also, you cannot delete a row from `Department` if that row's `ID` was a
`DepartmentID` in `Employee`.

### Composite Keys

Keys can also consist of more than one column. *Composite keys* can be
created as follows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE example (
    a INT,
    b INT,
    c INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (a, c));
```


## Auto-increment Columns

These are columns that the database manages, usually in an
ever-increasing sequence. It's perfect for generation unique, numeric
IDs for primary Keys.

> In some databases (e.g MySQL) this is done with an `AUTO_INCREMENT`
> keyword. PostgreSQL is different.

In PostgreSQL, use the `SERIAL` keyword to auto-generate sequential
numeric IDs for records.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Company (
    ID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(20));
```

When you insert, **do not** specify the ID column. You **must** however,
give a column name list that includes the remaining column names you are
inserting data for. The ID column will be automatically generated by the
database.

```sql
INSERT INTO Company (Name) VALUES ('My Awesome Company');
```


## Joins

*This concept is* extremely important *to understanding how to use
relational databases!*

When you have two (or more) tables with data you wish to retrieve from
both, you do so by using a *join*. These come in a number of varieties,
some of which are covered here.

When you're using `SELECT` to make the join between two tables, you can
specify the tables specific columns are from by using the `.` operator.
This is especially useful when columns have the same name in the
different tables:

```sql
SELECT Animal.name, Farm.name
    FROM Animal, Farm
    WHERE Animal.FarmID = Farm.ID;
```

Tables to use in these examples:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Department (
    ID INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(20));

CREATE TABLE Employee (
    ID INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(20),
    DepartmentID INT);

INSERT INTO Department VALUES (10, 'Marketing');
INSERT INTO Department VALUES (11, 'Sales');
INSERT INTO Department VALUES (12, 'Entertainment');

INSERT INTO Employee VALUES (1, 'Alice', 10);
INSERT INTO Employee VALUES (2, 'Bob', 12);
INSERT INTO Employee VALUES (3, 'Charlie', 99);
```

**NOTE**: Importantly, department ID 11 is not referred to from
`Employee`, and department ID 99 (Charlie) does not exist in
`Department`. This is instrumental in the following examples.


### Inner Join, The Most Common Join

This is the most commonly-used join, by far, and is what people mean
when they just say "join" with no further qualifiers.

This will return only the rows that match the requirements from **both**
tables.

For example, we don't see "Sales" or "Charlie" in the join because
neither of them match up to the other table:

    dbname=> SELECT Employee.ID, Employee.Name, Department.Name
                 FROM Employee, Department
                 WHERE Employee.DepartmentID = Department.ID;
    
     id | name  |     name      
    ----+-------+---------------
      1 | Alice | Marketing
      2 | Bob   | Entertainment
    (2 rows)

Above, we used a `WHERE` clause to perform the inner join. This is
absolutely the most common way to do it.

There is an alternative syntax, below, that is barely ever used.

    dbname=> SELECT Employee.ID, Employee.Name, Department.Name
                 FROM Employee INNER JOIN Department
                 ON Employee.DepartmentID = Department.ID;

     id | name  |     name      
    ----+-------+---------------
      1 | Alice | Marketing
      2 | Bob   | Entertainment
    (2 rows)

### Left Outer Join

This join works like an inner join, but also returns *all* the rows from
the "left" table (the one after the `FROM` clause). It puts `NULL`
in for the missing values in the "right" table (the one after the
`LEFT JOIN` clause.)

Example:

    dbname=> SELECT Employee.ID, Employee.Name, Department.Name
                 FROM Employee LEFT JOIN Department
                 ON Employee.DepartmentID = Department.ID;

     id |  name   |     name      
    ----+---------+---------------
      1 | Alice   | Marketing
      2 | Bob     | Entertainment
      3 | Charlie | 
    (3 rows)

Notice that even though Charlie's department isn't found in `Department`, his record is still listed with a `NULL` department name.


### Right Outer Join

This join works like an inner join, but also returns *all* the rows from
the "right" table (the one after the `RIGHT JOIN` clause). It puts
`NULL` in for the missing values in the "right" table (the one after the
`FROM` clause.)

    dbname=> SELECT Employee.ID, Employee.Name, Department.Name
                 FROM Employee RIGHT JOIN Department
                 ON Employee.DepartmentID = Department.ID;

     id | name  |     name      
    ----+-------+---------------
      1 | Alice | Marketing
      2 | Bob   | Entertainment
        |       | Sales
    (3 rows)

Notice that even though there are no employees in the Sales department,
the Sales name is listed with a `NULL` employee name.

### Full Outer Join

This is a blend of a Left and Right Outer Join. All information from
both tables is selected, with `NULL` filling the gaps where necessary.

     dbname=> SELECT Employee.ID, Employee.Name, Department.Name
                  FROM Employee
                  FULL JOIN Department
                  ON Employee.DepartmentID = Department.ID;
                
     id |  name   |     name      
    ----+---------+---------------
      1 | Alice   | Marketing
      2 | Bob     | Entertainment
      3 | Charlie | 
        |         | Sales
    (4 rows)

## Indexes

When searching through tables, you use a `WHERE` clause to narrow things
down. For speed, the columns mentioned in the `WHERE` clause should
either be a primary key, or a column for which an *index* has been
built.

Indexes help speed searches. In a large table, searching over an
unindexed column will be *slow*.

Example of creating an index on the Employee table from the
[Keys](#keys-primary-and-foreign) section:

    dbname=> CREATE INDEX ON Employee (LastName);
    CREATE INDEX

    dbname=> \d Employee
                            Table "public.employee"

## Transactions

In PostgreSQL, you can bundle a series of statements into a
*transaction*. The transaction is executed *atomically*, which means
either the entire transaction occurs, or none of the transaction occurs.
There will never be a case where a transaction partially occurs.

Create a transaction by starting with a `BEGIN` statement, followed by
all the statements that are to be within the transaction.

> `START TRANSACTION` is generally synonymous with `BEGIN` in SQL.

To execute the transaction ("Let's do it!"), end with a `COMMIT`
statement.

To abort the transaction and do nothing ("On second thought,
nevermind!") end with a `ROLLBACK` statement. *This makes it like
nothing within the transaction ever happened.*

Usually transactions happen within a program that checks for sanity and
either commits or rolls back.

Pseudocode making DB calls that check if a rollback is necessary:

```javascript
db("BEGIN"); // Begin transaction

db(`UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100.00
    WHERE name = 'Alice'`);

let balance = db("SELECT balance WHERE name = 'Alice'");

// Don't let the balance go below zero:
if (balance < 0) {
    db("ROLLBACK"); // Never mind!! Roll it all back.
} else {
    db("COMMIT"); // Plenty of cash
}
```
    
In the above example, the `UPDATE` and `SELECT` must happen at the same
time (*atomically*) or else another process could sneak in between and
withdraw too much money. Because it needs to be atomic, it's wrapped in
a transaction.

If you just enter a single SQL statement that is not inside a `BEGIN`
transaction block, it gets automatically wrapped in a `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`
block. It is a mini transaction that is `COMMIT`ted immediately.

Not all SQL databases support transactions, but most do.


## The EXPLAIN Command

The `EXPLAIN` command will tell you how much time the database is
spending doing a query, and what it's doing in that time.

It's a powerful command that can help tell you where you need to add
indexes, change structure, or rewrite queries.

    dbname=> EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM foo;
    
                           QUERY PLAN
    ---------------------------------------------------------
     Seq Scan on foo  (cost=0.00..155.00 rows=10000 width=4)
    (1 row)

For more information, see the [PostgreSQL EXPLAIN documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-explain.html)


## Quick and Dirty DB Design

Designing a non-trivial database is a difficult, learned skill best left to
professionals. Feel free to do small databases with minimal training, but if you
get in a professional situation with a large database that needs to be designed,
you should consult with people with strong domain knowledge.

That said, here are a couple pointers.

* In general, all your tables should have a unique `PRIMARY KEY` for each row.
  It's common to use `SERIAL` or `AUTO_INCREMENT` to make this happen.

* Keep an eye out for commonly duplicated data. If you are duplicating text data
  across several records, consider that maybe it should be in its own table and
  referred to with a foreign key.

* Watch out for unrelated data in the same record. If it's a record in the
  `Employee` table but it has `Department_Address` as a column, that probably
  belongs in a `Department` table, referred to by a public key.

But if you really want to design database, read on to the [Normalization and
Normal Forms](#normalization-and-normal-forms) section.


## Normalization and Normal Forms

*[This topic is very deep and this section cannot do it full justice.]*

*Normalization* is the process of designing or refactoring your tables
for maximum consistency and minimum redundancy.

With NoSQL databases, we're used to *denormalized* data that is stored
with speed in mind, and not so much consistency (sometimes NoSQL
databases talk about *eventual consistency*).

Non-normalized tables are considered an anti-pattern in relational databases.

There are many *normal forms*. We'll talk about First, Second, and Third
normal forms.


### Anomalies

One of the reasons for normalizing tables is to avoid *anomalies*.

*Insert anomaly*: When we cannot insert a row into the table because
some of the dependent information is not yet known. For example, we
cannot create a new class record in the school database, because the
record requires at least one student, and none have enrolled yet.

*Update anomaly*: When information is duplicated in the database *and*
some rows are updated but not others. For example, say a record contains
a city and a zipcode, but then the post office changes the zipcode. If
some of the records are updated but not others, some cities will have
the old zipcodes.

*Delete anomaly*: The opposite of an insert anomaly. When we delete some
information and other related information must also be deleted against
our will. For example, deleting the last student from a course causes
the other course information to be also deleted.

By normalizing your tables, you can avoid these anomalies.

### First Normal Form (1NF)

When a database is in first normal form, there is a primary key for each
row, and there are no repeating sets of columns that should be in their
own table.

Unnormalized (column titles on separate lines for clarity):

    Farm
        ID
        AnimalName1  AnimalBreed1  AnimalProducesEggs1
        AnimalName2  AnimalBreed2  AnimalProducesEggs2

1NF:

    Farm
        ID

    Animal
        ID  FarmID[FK Farm(ID)]  Name  Breed  ProducesEggs


Use a [*join*](#joins) to select all the animals in the farm:

```sql
SELECT Name, Farm.ID FROM Animal, Farm WHERE Farm.ID = Animal.FarmID;
```

### Second Normal Form (2NF)

To be in 2NF, a table must already be in 1NF.

Additionally, all non-key data must fully relate to the key data in the table.

In the farm example, above, Animal has a Name and a key FarmID, but
these two pieces of information are not related.

We can fix this by adding a table to link the other two tables together:

2NF:

    Farm
        ID

    FarmAnimal
        FarmID[FK Farm(ID)]  AnimalID[FK Animal(ID)]

    Animal
        ID  Name  Breed  ProducesEggs

Use a [*join*](#joins) to select all the animals in the farms:

```sql
SELECT Name, Farm.ID
    FROM Animal, FarmAnimal, Farm
    WHERE Farm.ID = FarmAnimal.FarmID AND
          Animal.ID = FarmAnimal.AnimalID;
```


### Third Normal Form (3NF)

A table in 3NF must already be in 2NF.

Additionally, columns that relate to each other AND to the key need to
be moved into their own tables. This is known as removing *transitive
dependencies*.

In the Farm example, the columns `Breed` and `ProducesEggs` are related.
If you know the breed, you automatically know if it produces eggs or
not.

3NF:

    Farm
        ID

    FarmAnimal
        FarmID[FK Farm(ID)]  AnimalID[FK Animal(ID)]

    BreedEggs
        Breed  ProducesEggs

    Animal
        ID  Name  Breed[FK BreedEggs(Breed)]

Use a [*join*](#joins) to select all the animals names that produce eggs
in the farm:

```sql
SELECT Name, Farm.ID
    FROM Animal, FarmAnimal, BreedEggs, Farm
    WHERE Farm.ID = FarmAnimal.FarmID AND
          Animal.ID = FarmAnimal.AnimalID AND
          Animal.Breed = BreedEggs.Breed AND
          BreedEggs.ProducesEggs = TRUE;
```

## Security

### PostgreSQL Password

You might have noticed that you don't need a password to access your
database that you created. This is because PostgreSQL by default uses
something called [peer authentication
mode](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/auth-methods.html#AUTH-PEER).

In a nutshell, it makes sure that you are logged in as yourself before
you access your database. If a different user tries to access your
database, they will be denied.

If you need to set up password access, see [client authentication in the
PostgreSQL
manual](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/client-authentication.html)

### Writing Client Software

When writing code that accesses databases, there are a few rules you
should follow to keep things safe.

* Don't store database passwords or other sensitive information in your
  code repository. Store dummy credentials instead.

* When building SQL queries in code, use [*parameterized
  queries*](https://node-postgres.com/features/queries#parameterized-query).
  You build your query with parameter placeholders for where the query
  arguments will go.
  
  This is your number-one line of defense against [SQL injection
  attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection).

  **It's a seriously noob move to not use parameterized queries.**


## Other Relational Databases

There are tons of them by Microsoft, Oracle, etc. etc.

Other popular open source databases in widespread use are:

* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) Multi-user, industrial class.
* [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) Single-user, very fast, good for config files.


## Assignment: Install PostgreSQL

**IMPORTANT!** These instructions assume you haven't already installed
PostgreSQL. If you have already installed it, skip this section or
Google for how to upgrade your installation.

### Mac with Homebrew

1. Open a terminal
2. Install PostgreSQL: `brew install postgresql`

    If you get install errors at this point relating to the link phase
    failing or missing permissions, look back in the output and see
    what file it failed to write.

    For example, if it's failing to write something in
    `/usr/local/share/man`-something, try setting the ownership on
    those directories to yourself.

    Example (from the command line):

    `$ sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local/share/man`

    Then try to install again.

3. Start the database process
    * If you want to start it every time you log in, run:

          brew services start postgresql

    * If you want to just start it one time right now, run:

          pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres start

4. Create a database named the same as your username: `createdb $(whoami)`
    * Optionally you can call it anything you want, but the shell
      defaults to looking for a database named the same as your user.

   This database will contain tables.

Then start a shell by running `psql` and see if it works. You should see
this prompt:

    $ psql
    psql (10.1)
    Type "help" for help.

    dbname=> 

(Use `psql databasename` if you created the database under something
other than your username.)

Use `\l` to get a list of databases.

You can enter `\q` to exit the shell.

### Windows

Reports are that one of the easiest installs is with
[chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/postgresql). Might want to try that
first.

You can also [download a Windows
installer](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/) from the
official site.

Another option is to use the [Windows Subsystem for
Linux](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/install-win10)
and follow the [Ubuntu instructions for installing
PostgreSQL](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PostgreSQL).


### Arch Linux

Arch requires a bit more hands-on, but not much more. Check this out if
you want to see a different Unix-y install procedure (or if you run
Arch).

* [Installing PostgreSQL on Arch
  Linux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PostgreSQL)


## Assignment: Create a Table and Use It

Launch the shell on your database, and create a table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employee (ID INT, FirstName VARCHAR(20), LastName VARCHAR(20));
```

Insert some records:

```sql
INSERT INTO Employee VALUES (1, 'Alpha', 'Alphason');
INSERT INTO Employee VALUES (2, 'Bravo', 'Bravoson');
INSERT INTO Employee VALUES (3, 'Charlie', 'Charleson');
INSERT INTO Employee VALUES (4, 'Delta', 'Deltason');
INSERT INTO Employee VALUES (5, 'Echo', 'Ecoson');
```

Select all records:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employee;
```

Select Employee #3's record:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employee WHERE ID=3;
```

Delete Employee #3's record:

```sql
DELETE FROM Employee WHERE ID=3;
```
 
Use `SELECT` to verify the record is deleted.

Update Employee #2's name to be "Foxtrot Foxtrotson":

```sql
UPDATE Employee SET FirstName='Foxtrot', LastName='Foxtrotson' WHERE ID=2;
```

Use `SELECT` to verify the update.


## Assignment: NodeJS Program to Create and Populate a Table

Using [Node-Postgres](https://node-postgres.com/), write a program that
creates a table.

Run the following query from your JS code:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Earthquake
    (Name VARCHAR(20), Magnitude REAL)
```

Populate the table with the following data:

```javascript
let data = [
    ["Earthquake 1", 2.2],
    ["Earthquake 2", 7.0],
    ["Earthquake 3", 1.8],
    ["Earthquake 4", 5.2],
    ["Earthquake 5", 2.9],
    ["Earthquake 6", 0.6],
    ["Earthquake 7", 6.6]
];
```

You'll have to run an `INSERT` statement for each one.

Open a PostgreSQL shell (`psql`) and verify the table exists:

    user-> \dt
              List of relations
     Schema |    Name    | Type  | Owner 
    --------+------------+-------+-------
     public | earthquake | table | user
    (1 row)

Also verify it is populated:

    user-> SELECT * from Earthquake;
    
         name     | magnitude 
    --------------+-----------
     Earthquake 1 |       2.2
     Earthquake 2 |         7
     Earthquake 3 |       1.8
     Earthquake 4 |       5.2
     Earthquake 5 |       2.9
     Earthquake 6 |       0.6
     Earthquake 7 |       6.6
    (7 rows)

Hints:
* [CREATE TABLE](#create-a-table-with-create-table)
* [Connecting to the database](https://node-postgres.com/features/connecting)
* [Running a query](https://node-postgres.com/features/queries)

Extra Credit:
* Add an ID column to help normalize the database. Make this column
  `SERIAL` to auto-increment.
* Add Date, Lat, and Lon columns to record more information about the
  event.


## Assignment: Command-line Earthquake Query Tool

Write a tool that queries the database for earthquakes that are at least
a given magnitude.

    $ node earthquake 2.9
    Earthquakes with magnitudes greater than or equal to 2.9:
    
    Earthquake 2: 7
    Earthquake 7: 6.6
    Earthquake 4: 5.2
    Earthquake 5: 2.9

Use `ORDER BY Magnitude DESC` to order the results in descending order
by magnitude.


## Assignment: RESTful Earthquake Data Server

Use [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/) and write a webserver that
implements a RESTful API to access the earthquake data.

Endpoints:

`/` (GET) Output usage information in HTML.

Example results:

```html
<html>
    <body>Usage: [endpoint info]</body>
</html>
```

`/minmag` (GET) Output JSON list of earthquakes that are larger than the
value specified in the `mag` parameter. Use form encoding to pass the
data.

Example results:

```json
{
    "results": [
        {
            "name": "Earthquake 2",
            "magnitude": 7
        },
        {
            "name": "Earthquake 4",
            "magnitude": 5.2
        }
    ]
}
```

Extra Credit:

`/new` (POST) Add a new earthquake to the database. Use form encoding to
pass `name` and `mag`. Return a JSON status message:

```json
{ "status": "ok" }
```

or

```json
{ "status": "error", "message": "[error message]" }
```


`/delete` (DELETE) Delete an earthquake from the database. Use form
encoding to pass `name`. Return status similar to `/new`, above.

# Building RESTful APIs with Express

## Topics

- Express Routing
- Reading Request data from body and URL parameters
- Sub-routes
- API design and development.

## Description

Use `Node.js` and `Express` to build an API that performs _CRUD_ operations on `blog posts`.

### Project Setup

- **Fork** and **Clone** this repository.
- **CD into the folder** where you cloned the repository.
- Type `npm install` to download all dependencies.
- To start the server, type `npm run server` from the root folder (where the _package.json_ file is). The server is configured to restart automatically as you make changes.

### Database Persistence Helpers

The `data` folder contains a database populated with test `posts`.

Database access will be done using the `db.js` file included inside the `data` folder.

The `db.js` publishes the following methods:

- `find()`: calling find returns a promise that resolves to an array of all the `posts` contained in the database.
- `findById()`: this method expects an `id` as it's only parameter and returns the post corresponding to the `id` provided or an empty array if no post with that `id` is found.
- `insert()`: calling insert passing it a `post` object will add it to the database and return an object with the `id` of the inserted post. The object looks like this: `{ id: 123 }`.
- `update()`: accepts two arguments, the first is the `id` of the post to update and the second is an object with the `changes` to apply. It returns the count of updated records. If the count is 1 it means the record was updated correctly.
- `remove()`: the remove method accepts an `id` as its first parameter and upon successfully deleting the post from the database it returns the number of records deleted.
- `findPostComments()`: the findPostComments accepts a `postId` as its first parameter and returns all comments on the post associated with the post id.
- `findCommentById()`: accepts an `id` and returns the comment associated with that id.
- `insertComment()`: calling insertComment while passing it a `comment` object will add it to the database and return an object with the `id` of the inserted comment. The object looks like this: `{ id: 123 }`. This method will throw an error if the `post_id` field in the `comment` object does not match a valid post id in the database.

Now that we have a way to add, update, remove and retrieve data from the provided database, it is time to work on the API.

### Blog Post Schema

A Blog Post in the database has the following structure:

```js
{
  title: "The post title", // String, required
  contents: "The post contents", // String, required
  created_at: Mon Aug 14 2017 12:50:16 GMT-0700 (PDT) // Date, defaults to current date
  updated_at: Mon Aug 14 2017 12:50:16 GMT-0700 (PDT) // Date, defaults to current date
}
```

### Comment Schema

A Comment in the database has the following structure:

```js
{
  text: "The text of the comment", // String, required
  post_id: "The id of the associated post", // Integer, required, must match the id of a post entry in the database
  created_at: Mon Aug 14 2017 12:50:16 GMT-0700 (PDT) // Date, defaults to current date
  updated_at: Mon Aug 14 2017 12:50:16 GMT-0700 (PDT) // Date, defaults to current date
}
```

### Minimum Viable Product

- Add the code necessary to implement the endpoints listed below.
- Separate the endpoints that begin with `/api/posts` into a separate `Express Router`.

### Endpoints

Configure the API to handle to the following routes:

| Method | Endpoint                | Description                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------ | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| POST   | /api/posts              | Creates a post using the information sent inside the `request body`.                                                                                                        |
| POST   | /api/posts/:id/comments | Creates a comment for the post with the specified id using information sent inside of the `request body`.                                                                   |
| GET    | /api/posts              | Returns an array of all the post objects contained in the database.                                                                                                         |
| GET    | /api/posts/:id          | Returns the post object with the specified id.                                                                                                                              |
| GET    | /api/posts/:id/comments | Returns an array of all the comment objects associated with the post with the specified id.                                                                                 |
| DELETE | /api/posts/:id          | Removes the post with the specified id and returns the **deleted post object**. You may need to make additional calls to the database in order to satisfy this requirement. |
| PUT    | /api/posts/:id          | Updates the post with the specified `id` using data from the `request body`. Returns the modified document, **NOT the original**.                                           |

#### Endpoint Specifications

When the client makes a `POST` request to `/api/posts`:

- If the request body is missing the `title` or `contents` property:

  - cancel the request.
  - respond with HTTP status code `400` (Bad Request).
  - return the following JSON response: `{ errorMessage: "Please provide title and contents for the post." }`.

- If the information about the _post_ is valid:

  - save the new _post_ the the database.
  - return HTTP status code `201` (Created).
  - return the newly created _post_.

- If there's an error while saving the _post_:
  - cancel the request.
  - respond with HTTP status code `500` (Server Error).
  - return the following JSON object: `{ error: "There was an error while saving the post to the database" }`.

When the client makes a `POST` request to `/api/posts/:id/comments`:

- If the _post_ with the specified `id` is not found:

  - return HTTP status code `200` (OK).
  - return the newly updated _post_.

## Stretch Problems

To work on the stretch problems you'll need to enable the `cors` middleware. Follow these steps:

- add the `cors` npm module: `npm i cors`.
- add `server.use(cors())` after `server.use(express.json())`.

Create a new React application and connect it to your server:

- Use `create-react-app` to create an application inside the root folder, name it `client`.
- From the React application connect to the `/api/posts` endpoint in the API and show the list of posts.
- Style the list of posts however you see fit.

title: 101
category: JavaScript libraries
layout: 2017/sheet
updated: 2017-09-21
intro: |
  [101](https://www.npmjs.com/package/101) is a JavaScript library for dealing with immutable data in a functional manner.
---

### Usage

```js
const isObject = require('101/isObject')
isObject({}) // → true
```

Every function is exposed as a module.

See: [101](https://github.com/tjmehta/101)

### Type checking

```js
isObject({})
isString('str')
isRegExp(/regexp/)
isBoolean(true)
isEmpty({})
isfunction(x => x)
isInteger(10)
isNumber(10.1)
instanceOf(obj, 'string')
```

## Objects
{: .-three-column}

### Example
{: .-prime}

```js
let obj = {}
```

#### Update

```js
obj = put(obj, 'user.name', 'John')
// → { user: { name: 'John' } }
```

#### Read

```js
pluck(name, 'user.name')
// → 'John'
```

#### Delete

```js
obj = del(obj, 'user')
// → { }
```

### Getting

```js
pluck(state, 'user.profile.name')
```

```js
pick(state, ['user', 'ui'])
pick(state, /^_/)
```

`pluck` returns values, `pick` returns subsets of objects.

See:
[pluck](https://github.com/tjmehta/101#pluck),
[pick](https://github.com/tjmehta/101#pick)

### Setting

```js
put(state, 'user.profile.name', 'john')
```

See:
[put](https://github.com/tjmehta/101#put)

### Deleting

```js
del(state, 'user.profile')
omit(state, ['user', 'data'])
```

`omit` is like `del`, but supports multiple keys to be deleted.

See:
[omit](https://github.com/tjmehta/101#omit),
[del](https://github.com/tjmehta/101#del)

### Keypath check

```js
hasKeypaths(state, ['user'])
hasKeypaths(state, { 'user.profile.name': 'john' })
```

See:
[hasKeypaths](https://github.com/tjmehta/101#haskeypaths)

### Get values

```js
values(state)
```

## Functions

### Simple functions

| `and(x, y)` | `x && y` |
| `or(x, y)` | `x || y` |
| `xor(x, y)` | `!(!x && !y) && !(x && y)` |
| `equals(x, y)` | `x === y` |
| `exists(x)` | `!!x` |
| `not(x)` | `!x` |

Useful for function composition.

See:
[and](https://github.com/tjmehta/101#and),
[equals](https://github.com/tjmehta/101#equals),
[exists](https://github.com/tjmehta/101#exists)

### Composition

```js
compose(f, g)       // x => f(g(x))
curry(f)            // x => y => f(x, y)
flip(f)             // f(x, y) --> f(y, x)
```

See:
[compose](https://github.com/tjmehta/101#compose),
[curry](https://github.com/tjmehta/101#curry),
[flip](https://github.com/tjmehta/101#flip)

### And/or

```js
passAll(f, g)       // x => f(x) && g(x)
passAny(f, g)       // x => f(x) || g(x)
```

See:
[passAll](https://github.com/tjmehta/101#passall),
[passAny](https://github.com/tjmehta/101#passany)

### Converge

```js
converge(and, [pluck('a'), pluck('b')])(x)
```

```js
// → and(pluck(x, 'a'), pluck(x, 'b'))
```

See:
[converge](https://github.com/tjmehta/101#converge)

## Arrays

### Finding

```js
find(list, x => x.y === 2)
findIndex(list, x => ...)
includes(list, 'item')
last(list)
```

```js
find(list, hasProps('id'))
```

### Grouping

```js
groupBy(list, 'id')
indexBy(list, 'id')
```

## Examples

### Function composition

```js
isFloat = passAll(isNumber, compose(isInteger, not))
// n => isNumber(n) && not(isInteger(n))
```

```js
function doStuff (object, options) { ... }

doStuffForce = curry(flip(doStuff))({ force: true })
```

title: Absinthe
category: Hidden
layout: 2017/sheet
tags: [WIP]
updated: 2017-10-10
intro: |
  [Absinthe](http://absinthe-graphql.org/) allows you to write GraphQL servers in Elixir.
---

## Introduction

### Concepts

- `Schema` - The root. Defines what queries you can do, and what types they return.
- `Resolver` - Functions that return data.
- `Type` - A type definition describing the shape of the data you'll return.

### Plug

#### web/router.ex

```elixir
defmodule Blog.Web.Router do
  use Phoenix.Router

  forward "/", Absinthe.Plug,
    schema: Blog.Schema
end
```
{: data-line="4,5"}

Absinthe is a Plug, and you pass it one **Schema**.

See: [Our first query](http://absinthe-graphql.org/tutorial/our-first-query/)

## Main concepts
{: .-three-column}

### Schema

#### web/schema.ex

```elixir
defmodule Blog.Schema do
  use Absinthe.Schema
  import_types Blog.Schema.Types

  query do
    @desc "Get a list of blog posts"
    field :posts, list_of(:post) do
      resolve &Blog.PostResolver.all/2
    end
  end
end
```
{: data-line="5,6,7,8,9,10"}

This schema will account for `{ posts { ··· } }`. It returns a **Type** of `:post`, and delegates to a **Resolver**.

### Resolver

#### web/resolvers/post_resolver.ex

```elixir
defmodule Blog.PostResolver do
  def all(_args, _info) do
    {:ok, Blog.Repo.all(Blog.Post)}
  end
end
```
{: data-line="3"}

This is the function that the schema delegated the `posts` query to.

### Type

#### web/schema/types.ex

```elixir
defmodule Blog.Schema.Types do
  use Absinthe.Schema.Notation

  @desc "A blog post"
  object :post do
    field :id, :id
    field :title, :string
    field :body, :string
  end
end
```
{: data-line="4,5,6,7,8,9"}

This defines a type `:post`, which is used by the resolver.

## Schema

### Query arguments

#### GraphQL query

```
{ user(id: "1") { ··· } }
```

#### web/schema.ex

```elixir
query do
  field :user, type: :user do
    arg :id, non_null(:id)
    resolve &Blog.UserResolver.find/2
  end
end
```
{: data-line="3"}

#### Resolver

```elixir
def find(%{id: id} = args, _info) do
  ···
end
```
{: data-line="1"}

See: [Query arguments](http://absinthe-graphql.org/tutorial/query-arguments/)

### Mutations

#### GraphQL query

```
{
  mutation CreatePost {
    post(title: "Hello") { id }
  }
}
```

#### web/schema.ex

```elixir
mutation do
  @desc "Create a post"
  field :post, type: :post do
    arg :title, non_null(:string)
    resolve &Blog.PostResolver.create/2
  end
end
```
{: data-line="1"}

See: [Mutations](http://absinthe-graphql.org/tutorial/mutations/)

### Listing scopes

Allows you to filter listings by a certain scope.
{: .-setup}

```ruby
scope :draft
scope :for_approval
```

```ruby
scope :public, if: ->{ current_admin_user.can?(...) }
scope "Unapproved", :pending
scope("Published") { |books| books.where(:published: true) }
```

### Sidebar filters

```ruby
filter :email
filter :username
```

### Custom actions

You can define custom actions for models.
{: .-setup}

```ruby
before_filter only: [:show, :edit, :publish] do
  @post = Post.find(params[:id])
end
```

#### Make the route

```ruby
member_action :publish, method: :put do
  @post.publish!
  redirect_to admin_posts_path, notice: "The post '#{@post}' has been published!"
end
```

#### Link it in the index

```ruby
index do
  column do |post|
    link_to 'Publish', publish_admin_post_path(post), method: :put
  end
end
```

#### And link it in show/edit

```ruby
action_item only: [:edit, :show] do
  @post = Post.find(params[:id])
  link_to 'Publish', publish_admin_post_path(post), method: :put
end
```

### Columns

```ruby
column :foo
```

```ruby
column :title, sortable: :name do |post|
  strong post.title
end
```

### Other helpers

```ruby
status_tag "Done"           # Gray
status_tag "Finished", :ok  # Green
status_tag "You", :warn     # Orange
status_tag "Failed", :error # Red
```

### Disabling 'new post'

```ruby
ActiveAdmin.register Post do
  actions :index, :edit
  # or: config.clear_action_items!
end
```

```html
    <html ng-app="nameApp">
```

### Lists (ng-repeat)
```html
    <ul ng-controller="MyListCtrl">
      <li ng-repeat="phone in phones">
        {{phone.name}}
      </li>
    </ul>
```

### Model (ng-model)

```html
    <select ng-model="orderProp">
      <option value="name">Alphabetical</option>
      <option value="age">Newest</option>
    </select>
```

### Defining a module
```js
    App = angular.module('myApp', []);

    App.controller('MyListCtrl', function ($scope) {
      $scope.phones = [ ... ];
    });
```

### Controller with protection from minification
```js
    App.controller('Name', [
      '$scope',
      '$http',
      function ($scope, $http) {
      }
    ]);

    a.c 'name', [
      '$scope'
      '$http'
      ($scope, $http) ->
    ]
```

### Service
```js
    App.service('NameService', function($http){
      return {
        get: function(){
          return $http.get(url);
        }
      }
    });
```
In controller you call with parameter and will use promises to return data from server.

```js
    App.controller('controllerName',
    function(NameService){
      NameService.get()
      .then(function(){})
    })
```

### Directive
```js
    App.directive('name', function(){
      return {
        template: '<h1>Hello</h1>'
      }
    });
```

In HTML will use `<name></name>` to render your template `<h1>Hello</h1>`

### HTTP
```js
    App.controller('PhoneListCtrl', function ($scope, $http) {
        $http.get('/data.json').success(function (data) {
            $scope.phones = data;
        })
    });
```

## Animated GIFs
{: .-one-column}

### Convert MP4 to GIF

```bash
mkdir -p gif
mplayer -ao null -vo gif89a:outdir=gif $INPUT
mogrify -format gif *.png
gifsicle --colors=256 --delay=4 --loopcount=0 --dither -O3 gif/*.gif > ${INPUT%.*}.gif
rm -rf gif
```

You'll need `mplayer`, `imagemagick` and `gifsicle`. This converts frames to .png, then turns them into an animated gif.

### A given range

```bash
mplayer -ao null -ss 0:02:06 -endpos 0:05:00 -vo gif89a:outdir=gif videofile.mp4
```

See `-ss` and `-endpos`.

  A quick guide to getting started with your first Ansible playbook.
---

### Install Ansible

```bash
$ brew install ansible            # OSX
$ [sudo] apt install ansible      # elsewhere
```

Ansible is available as a package in most OS's.

See: [Installation](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_installation.html)

### Start your project

```bash
~$ mkdir setup
~$ cd setup
```

Make a folder for your Ansible files.

See: [Getting started](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_getting_started.html)

## Creating your files

### Inventory file

#### ~/setup/hosts

```dosini
[sites]
127.0.0.1
192.168.0.1
192.168.0.2
192.168.0.3
```

This is a list of hosts you want to manage, grouped into groups. (Hint: try
using `localhost ansible_connection=local` to deploy to your local machine.)

See: [Intro to Inventory](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_inventory.html)

### Playbook

#### ~/setup/playbook.yml

```yaml
- hosts: 127.0.0.1
  user: root
  tasks:
    - name: install nginx
      apt: pkg=nginx state=present

    - name: start nginx every bootup
      service: name=nginx state=started enabled=yes

    - name: do something in the shell
      shell: echo hello > /tmp/abc.txt

    - name: install bundler
      gem: name=bundler state=latest
```

See: [Intro to Playbooks](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbooks_intro.html)

## Running

### Running ansible-playbook

```
~/setup$ ls
hosts
playbook.yml
```

#### Running the playbook

```
~/setup$ ansible-playbook -i hosts playbook.yml

title: Arel
category: Rails
---

### Tables

```rb
users = Arel::Table.new(:users)
users = User.arel_table  # ActiveRecord model
```

### Fields

```rb
users[:name]
users[:id]
```

### `where` (restriction)

```rb
users.where(users[:name].eq('amy'))
# SELECT * FROM users WHERE users.name = 'amy'
```

### `select` (projection)

```rb
users.project(users[:id])
# SELECT users.id FROM users
```

### `join`
#### basic join
In ActiveRecord (without Arel), if `:photos` is the name of the association, use `joins`
```rb
users.joins(:photos)
```

In Arel, if `photos` is defined as the Arel table,
```rb
photos = Photo.arel_table
users.join(photos) 
users.join(photos, Arel::Nodes::OuterJoin).on(users[:id].eq(photos[:user_id]))
```

#### join with conditions
```rb
users.joins(:photos).merge(Photo.where(published: true))
```

If the simpler version doesn't help and you want to add more SQL statements to it:
```rb
users.join(
   users.join(photos, Arel::Nodes::OuterJoin)
   .on(photos[:user_id].eq(users[:id]).and(photos[:published].eq(true)))
)
```

#### advanced join
multiple `joins` with the same table but different meanings and/or conditions
```rb
creators = User.arel_table.alias('creators')
updaters = User.arel_table.alias('updaters')
photos = Photo.arel_table

photos_with_credits = photos
.join(photos.join(creators, Arel::Nodes::OuterJoin).on(photos[:created_by_id].eq(creators[:id])))
.join(photos.join(updaters, Arel::Nodes::OuterJoin).on(photos[:assigned_id].eq(updaters[:id])))
.project(photos[:name], photos[:created_at], creators[:name].as('creator'), updaters[:name].as('editor'))

photos_with_credits.to_sql
# => "SELECT `photos`.`name`, `photos`.`created_at`, `creators`.`name` AS creator, `updaters`.`name` AS editor FROM `photos` INNER JOIN (SELECT FROM `photos` LEFT OUTER JOIN `users` `creators` ON `photos`.`created_by_id` = `creators`.`id`) INNER JOIN (SELECT FROM `photos` LEFT OUTER JOIN `users` `updaters` ON `photos`.`updated_by_id` = `updaters`.`id`)"

# after the request is done, you can use the attributes you named
# it's as if every Photo record you got has "creator" and "editor" fields, containing creator name and editor name
photos_with_credits.map{|x|
  "#{photo.name} - copyright #{photo.created_at.year} #{photo.creator}, edited by #{photo.editor}"
}.join('; ')
```

### `limit` / `offset`

```rb
users.take(5) # => SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 5
users.skip(4) # => SELECT * FROM users OFFSET 4
```

### Aggregates

```rb
users.project(users[:age].sum) # .average .minimum .maximum
users.project(users[:id].count)
users.project(users[:id].count.as('user_count'))
```

### `order`

```rb
users.order(users[:name])
users.order(users[:name], users[:age].desc)
users.reorder(users[:age])
```

### With ActiveRecord

```rb
User.arel_table
User.where(id: 1).arel
```

### Clean code with arel

Most of the clever stuff should be in scopes, e.g. the code above could become:
```rb
photos_with_credits = Photo.with_creator.with_editor
```

You can store requests in variables then add SQL segments:
```rb
all_time      = photos_with_credits.count
this_month    = photos_with_credits.where(photos[:created_at].gteq(Date.today.beginning_of_month))
recent_photos = photos_with_credits.where(photos[:created_at].gteq(Date.today.beginning_of_month)).limit(5)
```

category: React
layout: 2017/sheet
updated: 2017-11-19

### redux-actions

Create action creators in flux standard action format.
{: .-setup}

```js
increment = createAction('INCREMENT', amount => amount)
increment = createAction('INCREMENT')  // same
```

```js
increment(42) === { type: 'INCREMENT', payload: 42 }
```

```js
// Errors are handled for you:
err = new Error()
increment(err) === { type: 'INCREMENT', payload: err, error: true }
```

[redux-actions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-actions)
{: .-crosslink}

### flux-standard-action

A standard for flux action objects. An action may have an `error`, `payload` and `meta` and nothing else.
{: .-setup}

```js
{ type: 'ADD_TODO', payload: { text: 'Work it' } }
{ type: 'ADD_TODO', payload: new Error(), error: true }
```

[flux-standard-action](https://github.com/acdlite/flux-standard-action)
{: .-crosslink}

### redux-multi

Dispatch multiple actions in one action creator.
{: .-setup}

```js
store.dispatch([
  { type: 'INCREMENT', payload: 2 },
  { type: 'INCREMENT', payload: 3 }
])
```

[redux-multi](https://github.com/ashaffer/redux-multi)
{: .-crosslink}

### reduce-reducers
Combines reducers (like *combineReducers()*), but without namespacing magic.
{: .-setup}

```js
re = reduceReducers(
  (state, action) => state + action.number,
  (state, action) => state + action.number
)

re(10, { number: 2 })  //=> 14
```

[reduce-reducers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reduce-reducers)
{: .-crosslink}

### redux-logger

Logs actions to your console.
{: .-setup}

```js
// Nothing to see here
```

[redux-logger](https://github.com/evgenyrodionov/redux-logger)
{: .-crosslink}

Async
-----

### redux-promise

Pass promises to actions. Dispatches a flux-standard-action.
{: .-setup}

```js
increment = createAction('INCREMENT')  // redux-actions
increment(Promise.resolve(42))
```

[redux-promise](https://github.com/acdlite/redux-promise)
{: .-crosslink}

### redux-promises

Sorta like that, too. Works by letting you pass *thunks* (functions) to `dispatch()`. Also has 'idle checking'.
{: .-setup}

```js
fetchData = (url) => (dispatch) => {
  dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_REQUEST' })
  fetch(url)
    .then((data) => dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_DONE', data })
    .catch((error) => dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_ERROR', error })
})

store.dispatch(fetchData('/posts'))
```

```js
// That's actually shorthand for:
fetchData('/posts')(store.dispatch)
```

[redux-promises](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-promises)
{: .-crosslink}

### redux-effects

Pass side effects declaratively to keep your actions pure.
{: .-setup}

```js
{
  type: 'EFFECT_COMPOSE',
  payload: {
    type: 'FETCH'
    payload: {url: '/some/thing', method: 'GET'}
  },
  meta: {
    steps: [ [success, failure] ]
  }
}
```

[redux-effects](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-effects)
{: .-crosslink}

### redux-thunk

Pass "thunks" to as actions. Extremely similar to redux-promises, but has support for getState.
{: .-setup}

```js
fetchData = (url) => (dispatch, getState) => {
  dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_REQUEST' })
  fetch(url)
    .then((data) => dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_DONE', data })
    .catch((error) => dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_ERROR', error })
})

store.dispatch(fetchData('/posts'))
```

```js
// That's actually shorthand for:
fetchData('/posts')(store.dispatch, store.getState)
```

```js
// Optional: since fetchData returns a promise, it can be chained
// for server-side rendering
store.dispatch(fetchPosts()).then(() => {
  ReactDOMServer.renderToString(<MyApp store={store} />)
})
```

[redux-thunk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-thunk)
{: .-crosslink}

object.off('change')              // all 'change' callbacks
object.off(null, onChange)        // `onChange` callback for all events
object.off(null, null, context)   // all callbacks for `context` all events
object.off()                      // all

### Introduction
{: .-intro}

This is a quick reference to getting started with Bash scripting.

- [Learn bash in y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/bash/) _(learnxinyminutes.com)_
- [Bash Guide](http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide) _(mywiki.wooledge.org)_

### Example

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

NAME="John"
echo "Hello $NAME!"
```

### Variables

```bash
NAME="John"
echo $NAME
echo "$NAME"
echo "${NAME}!"
```

### String quotes

```bash
NAME="John"
echo "Hi $NAME"  #=> Hi John
echo 'Hi $NAME'  #=> Hi $NAME
```

### Shell execution

```bash
echo "I'm in $(pwd)"
echo "I'm in `pwd`"
# Same
```

See [Command substitution](http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/syntax/expansion/cmdsubst)

### Conditional execution

```bash
git commit && git push
git commit || echo "Commit failed"
```

### Functions
{: id='functions-example'}

```bash
get_name() {
  echo "John"
}

echo "You are $(get_name)"
```

See: [Functions](#functions)

### Conditionals
{: id='conditionals-example'}

```bash
if [[ -z "$string" ]]; then
  echo "String is empty"
elif [[ -n "$string" ]]; then
  echo "String is not empty"
fi
```

See: [Conditionals](#conditionals)

### Strict mode

```bash
set -euo pipefail
IFS=$'\n\t'
```

See: [Unofficial bash strict mode](http://redsymbol.net/articles/unofficial-bash-strict-mode/)

### Brace expansion

```bash
echo {A,B}.js
```

| Expression | Description         |
| ---------- | ------------------- |
| `{A,B}`    | Same as `A B`       |
| `{A,B}.js` | Same as `A.js B.js` |
| `{1..5}`   | Same as `1 2 3 4 5` |

See: [Brace expansion](http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/syntax/expansion/brace)


Parameter expansions
--------------------
{: .-three-column}

### Basics

```bash
name="John"
echo ${name}
echo ${name/J/j}    #=> "john" (substitution)
echo ${name:0:2}    #=> "Jo" (slicing)
echo ${name::2}     #=> "Jo" (slicing)
echo ${name::-1}    #=> "Joh" (slicing)
echo ${name:(-1)}   #=> "n" (slicing from right)
echo ${name:(-2):1} #=> "h" (slicing from right)
echo ${food:-Cake}  #=> $food or "Cake"
```

```bash
length=2
echo ${name:0:length}  #=> "Jo"
```

See: [Parameter expansion](http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/syntax/pe)

```bash
STR="/path/to/foo.cpp"
echo ${STR%.cpp}    # /path/to/foo
echo ${STR%.cpp}.o  # /path/to/foo.o
echo ${STR%/*}      # /path/to

echo ${STR##*.}     # cpp (extension)
echo ${STR##*/}     # foo.cpp (basepath)

echo ${STR#*/}      # path/to/foo.cpp
echo ${STR##*/}     # foo.cpp

echo ${STR/foo/bar} # /path/to/bar.cpp
```

```bash
STR="Hello world"
echo ${STR:6:5}   # "world"
echo ${STR: -5:5}  # "world"
```

```bash
SRC="/path/to/foo.cpp"
BASE=${SRC##*/}   #=> "foo.cpp" (basepath)
DIR=${SRC%$BASE}  #=> "/path/to/" (dirpath)
```

### Substitution

| Code              | Description         |
| ----------------- | ------------------- |
| `${FOO%suffix}`   | Remove suffix       |
| `${FOO#prefix}`   | Remove prefix       |
| ---               | ---                 |
| `${FOO%%suffix}`  | Remove long suffix  |
| `${FOO##prefix}`  | Remove long prefix  |
| ---               | ---                 |
| `${FOO/from/to}`  | Replace first match |
| `${FOO//from/to}` | Replace all         |
| ---               | ---                 |
| `${FOO/%from/to}` | Replace suffix      |
| `${FOO/#from/to}` | Replace prefix      |

### Comments

```bash
# Single line comment
```

```bash
: '
This is a
multi line
comment
'
```

### Substrings

| Expression      | Description                    |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `${FOO:0:3}`    | Substring _(position, length)_ |
| `${FOO:(-3):3}` | Substring from the right       |

### Length

| Expression | Description      |
| ---------- | ---------------- |
| `${#FOO}`  | Length of `$FOO` |

### Manipulation

```bash
STR="HELLO WORLD!"
echo ${STR,}   #=> "hELLO WORLD!" (lowercase 1st letter)
echo ${STR,,}  #=> "hello world!" (all lowercase)

STR="hello world!"
echo ${STR^}   #=> "Hello world!" (uppercase 1st letter)
echo ${STR^^}  #=> "HELLO WORLD!" (all uppercase)
```

### Default values

| Expression        | Description                                              |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `${FOO:-val}`     | `$FOO`, or `val` if unset (or null)                      |
| `${FOO:=val}`     | Set `$FOO` to `val` if unset (or null)                   |
| `${FOO:+val}`     | `val` if `$FOO` is set (and not null)                    |
| `${FOO:?message}` | Show error message and exit if `$FOO` is unset (or null) |

Omitting the `:` removes the (non)nullity checks, e.g. `${FOO-val}` expands to `val` if unset otherwise `$FOO`.

Loops
-----
{: .-three-column}

### Basic for loop

```bash
for i in /etc/rc.*; do
  echo $i
done
```

### C-like for loop

```bash
for ((i = 0 ; i < 100 ; i++)); do
  echo $i
done
```

### Ranges

```bash
for i in {1..5}; do
    echo "Welcome $i"
done
```

#### With step size

```bash
for i in {5..50..5}; do
    echo "Welcome $i"
done
```

### Reading lines

```bash
cat file.txt | while read line; do
  echo $line
done
```

### Forever

```bash
while true; do
  ···
done
```

Functions
---------
{: .-three-column}

### Defining functions

```bash
myfunc() {
    echo "hello $1"
}
```

```bash
# Same as above (alternate syntax)
function myfunc() {
    echo "hello $1"
}
```

```bash
myfunc "John"
```

### Returning values

```bash
myfunc() {
    local myresult='some value'
    echo $myresult
}
```

```bash
result="$(myfunc)"
```

### Raising errors

```bash
myfunc() {
  return 1
}
```

```bash
if myfunc; then
  echo "success"
else
  echo "failure"
fi
```

### Arguments

| Expression | Description                                     |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `$#`       | Number of arguments                             |
| `$*`       | All postional arguments  (as a single word)     |
| `$@`       | All postitional arguments (as separate strings) |
| `$1`       | First argument                                  |
| `$_`       | Last argument of the previous command           |

**Note**: `$@` and `$*` must be quoted in order to perform as described.
Otherwise, they do exactly the same thing (arguments as separate strings).

See [Special parameters](http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/syntax/shellvars#special_parameters_and_shell_variables).

Conditionals
------------
{: .-three-column}

### Conditions

**Variables** are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a computer program. A variable's sole purpose is to label and store data in computer memory. Up to this point we've been using the `let` keyword as our only way of declaring a JavaScript variable. It's now time to expand your tool set to learn about the different kinds of JavaScript variables you can use!

When you finish this reading, you should be able to:

* Identify the three keywords used to declare a variable in JavaScript
* Explain the differences between `const`, `let` and `var`
* Identify the difference between function and block-scoped variables
* Paraphrase the concept of hoisting in regards to function and block-scoped

  variables

### Declaring variables

All the code you write in JavaScript is _evaluated_. **A variable always evaluates to the value it contains no matter how you declare it.**

#### The different ways to declare variables

In the beginning there was `var`. The `var` keyword used to be the only way to declare a JavaScript variable. However, in ECMAScript 2015 JavaScript introduced two new ways of declaring JavaScript variables: `let` and `const`. Meaning, in JavaScript there are **three different ways to declare a variable**. Each of these keywords has advantages and disadvantages and we will now talk about each keyword at length.

1. `let`: any variables declared with the keyword `let` _allows you to reassign_

   that variable. Variable declared using `let` is scoped within a **block**.

2. `const`: any variables declared with the keyword `const` \_will not allow you

   to reassign\_ that variable. Variable declared using `const` is scoped within

   a **block**.

3. `var`: A `var` declared variable may or may not be reassigned, and the

   variable is **scoped to a function**.

For this course and for your programming career moving forward we recommend you **always** use `let` & `const`. These two words allow us to be the most clear with our intentions for the variable we are creating.

### Hoisting and scoping with variables

A wonderful definition of hoisting by Mabishi Wakio, "Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution."

What this means is that when you run JavaScript code the variables and function declarations will be _hoisted_ to the top of their particular scope. This is important because `const` and `let` are **block-scoped** while `var` is **function-scoped**.

Let's start by talking more about all `const`, `let`, and `var` before we dive into why the difference of scopes and hoisting is important.

#### Function-scoped variables

When JavaScript was young the only available variable was `var`. The `var` keyword creates _function-scoped_ variables. That means when you use the `var` keyword to declare a variable that variable will be confined to the scope of the current function.

Here is a simple example of declaring a `var` variable within a function:

```javascript
function test() {
  var a = 10;

  console.log(a); // => 10
}
```

One of the drawbacks of using `var` is that it is a less indicative way of defining a variable.

**Hoisting with function-scoped variables**

Let's take a look at what hoisting does to a function-scoped variable:

```javascript
function test() {
  console.log(hoistedVar); // => undefined

  var hoistedVar = 10;
}

test();
```

Huh - that's weird. You'd expect an error from referring to a variable like `hoistedVar` before it's defined, something like: `ReferenceError: hoistedVar is not defined`. However this is not the case because of _hoisting_ in JavaScript!

So essentially hoisting will isolate and, in the computer's memory, will declare a variable as the top of it's scope. With a function-scoped variable, `var`, the name of the variable will be hoisted to the top of the function. In the above snippet, since `hoistedVar` is declared using the `var` keyword the `hoistedVar`'s scope is the `test` function. To be clear what is being hoisted is the _declaration_, not the _assignment_ itself.

In JavaScript, all variables defined with the `var` keyword have an initial value of `undefined`. Here is a translation of how JavaScript would deal with hoisting in the above `test` function:

```javascript
function test() {
  // JavaScript will declare the variable *in computer memory* at the top of it's scope
  var hoistedVar;

  // since hoisting declared the variable above we now get
  // the value of 'undefined'
  console.log(hoistedVar); // =>  undefined

  var hoistedVar = 10;
}
```

#### Block-scoped variables

When you are declaring a variable with the keyword `let` or `const` you are declaring a variable that exists within _block scope_. Blocks in JavaScript are denoted by curly braces\(`{}`\). The following examples create a block scope: `if` statements, `while` loops, `switch` statements, and `for` loops.

**Using the keyword let**

We can use `let` to declare **re-assignable block-scoped variables**. You are, of course, very familiar with `let` so let's take a look at how `let` works within a block scope:

```javascript
function blockScope() {
  let test = "upper scope";
  if (true) {
    let test = "lower scope";
    console.log(test); // "lower scope"
  }
  console.log(test); // "upper scope"
}
```

In the example above we can see that the `test` variable was declared twice using the keyword `let` but since they were declared within different scopes they have different values.

JavaScript will raise a `SyntaxError` if you try to declare the same `let` variable twice in one block.

```javascript
if (true) {
  let test = "this works!";
  let test = "nope!"; // Identifier 'test' has already been declared
}
```

Whereas if you try the same example with `var`:

```javascript
var test = "this works!";
var test = "nope!";
console.log(test); // prints "nope!"
```

We can see above that `var` will allow you to redeclare a variable twice which can lead to some very confusing and frustrating debugging.

Feel free to peruse the [documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let) for the keyword `let` for more examples.

**Using the keyword const**

We use `const` to declare **block-scoped variables** that can **not** be reassigned. In JavaScript variables that cannot be reassigned are called **constants**. Constants should be used for values that will not be re-declared or re-assigned.

Properties of constants:

* They are block-scoped like `let`.
* JavaScript enforces constants by raising an error if you try to reassign them.
* Trying to redeclare a constant with a `var` or `let` by the same name will

  also raise an error.

Let's look at a quick example of what happens when trying to reassign a constant:

```javascript
> const favFood = "cheeseboard pizza"; // Initializes a constant
undefined

> const favFood = "inferior food"; // Re-initialization raises an error
TypeError: Identifier 'favFood' has already been declared

> let favFood = "other inferior food"; // Re-initialization raises an error
TypeError: Identifier 'favFood' has already been declared

> favFood = "deep-dish pizza"; // Re-assignment raises an error
TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```

We cannot reassign a constant, but constants that are assigned to Reference types are **mutable**. The name binding of a constant is immutable. For example, if we set a constant equal to an Reference type like an object, we can still modify that object:

```javascript
const animals = {};
animals.big = "beluga whale"; // This works!
animals.small = "capybara"; // This works!

animals = { big: "beluga whale" }; // Will error because of the reassignment
```

Constants cannot be reassigned but, just like with `let`, new constants of the same names can be declared within nested scopes.

Take a look at the following for an example:

```javascript
const favFood = "cheeseboard pizza";
console.log(favFood);

if (true) {
  // This works! Declaration is scoped to the `if` block
  const favFood = "noodles";
  console.log(favFood); // Prints "noodles"
}

console.log(favFood); // Prints 'cheeseboard pizza'
```

Just like with `let` when you use `const` twice in the same block JavaScript will raise a `SyntaxError`.

```javascript
if (true) {
  const test = "this works!";
  const test = "nope!"; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'test' has already been declared
}
```

**Hoisting with block-scoped variables**

When JavaScript ES6 introduced new ways of declaring a variable using `let` and `const` the idea of block-level hoisting was also introduced. Block scope hoisting allows developers to avoid previous debugging debacles that naturally happened from using `var`.

Let's take a look at what hoisting does to a _block-scoped_ variable:

```javascript
if (true) {
  console.log(str); // => Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access 'str' before initialization
  const str = "apple";
}
```

Looking at the above we can see that an explicit error is thrown if you attempt to use a block-scoped variable before it was declared. This is the typical behavior in a lot of programming languages - that a variable cannot be referred to until initialized to a value.

However, JavaScript is still performing hoisting with block-scoped declared variables. The difference lies is how it _initializes_ them. Meaning that `let` and `const` variables are **not** initialized to the value of `undefined`.

The time before a `let` or `const` variable is declared, but not used is called the _Temporal Dead Zone_. A very cool name for a simple idea. Variables declared using `let` and `const` are not initialized until their definitions are evaluated. Meaning, you will get an error if you try to reference a `let` or `const` declared variable before it is evaluated.

Let's look at one more example that should illuminate the presence of the _Temporal Dead Zone_:

```javascript
var str = "not apple";

if (true) {
  console.log(str); //Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access 'str' before initialization
  let str = "apple";
}
```

In the above example we can see that inside the `if` block the `let` declared variable, `str`, throws an error. Showing that the error thrown by a `let` variable in the temporal dead zone takes precedence over any scope chaining that would attempt to go to the outer scope to find a value for the `str` variable.

#### Function scope vs. block scope

Let's now take a deeper look at the comparison of using function vs. block scoped variables.

Let's start with a simple example:

```javascript
function partyMachine() {
  var string = "party";
  console.log("this is a " + string);
}
```

Looks good so far but let's take that example a step farther and see some of the less fun parts of the `var` keyword in terms of scope:

```javascript
function partyMachine() {
  var string = "party";

  if (true) {
    // since var is not block-scoped and not constant
    // this assignment sticks!
    var string = "bummer";
  }

  console.log("this is a " + string);
}

partyMachine(); // => "this is a bummer"
```

We can see in the above example how the flexibility of `var` can ultimately be a bad thing. Since `var` is function-scoped _and_ can be reassigned and re-declared without error it is very easy to overwrite variable values by accident.

This is the problem that ES6 introduced `let` and `const` to solve. Since `let` and `const` are block-scoped it's a lot easier to avoid accidentally overwriting variable values.

Let's take a look at the example function above rewritten using `let` and `const`:

```javascript
function partyMachine() {
  const string = "party";

  if (true) {
    // this variable is restricted to the scope of this block
    const string = "bummer";
  }

  console.log("this is a " + string);
}
partyMachine(); // => "this is a party"
```

### Global variables

If you leave off a declaration when initializing a variable, it will become a global. **Do not do this.** We declare variables using the keywords `var`, `let`, and `const` to ensure that our variables are declared within a proper scope. Any variables declared without these keywords will be declared on the _global scope_.

JavaScript has a single global scope, which means all of the files from your projects and any libraries you use will **all be sharing the same scope**. Every time a variable is declared on the global scope, the chance of a name collision increases. If we are unaware of the global variables in our code, we may accidentally overwrite variables.

Let's look at a quick example showing why this is a bad idea:

```javascript
function good() {
  let x = 5;
  let y = "yay";
}

function bad() {
  y = "Expect the unexpected (eg. globals)";
}

function why() {
  console.log(y); // "Expect the unexpected (eg. globals)""
  console.log(x); // Raises an error
}

why();
```

Limiting global variables will help you create code that is much more easily maintainable. Strive to write your functions so that they are self-contained and not reliant on outside variables. This will also be a huge help in allowing us test each function by itself.

One of our jobs as programmers is to write code that can be integrated easily within a team. In order to do that, we need to limit the number of globally declared variables in our code as much as possible, to avoid accidental name collisions.

Sloppy programmers use global variables, and you are not working so hard in order to be a sloppy programmer!



The **scope** of a program in JavaScript is the set of variables that are available for use within the program. If a variable or other expression is not in the current scope, then it is unavailable for use. If we declare a variable, this variable will only be valid in the scope where we declared it. We can have nested scopes, but we'll see that in a little bit.

When we declare a variable in a certain scope, it will evaluate to a specific value **in that scope**. We have been using the concept of scope in our code all along! Now we are just giving this concept a name.

By the end of this reading you should be able to predict the evaluation of code that utilizes local scope, block scope, lexical scope, and scope chaining

### Advantages of utilizing scope

Before we start talking about different types of scope we'll be talking about the two main advantages that scope gives us:

1. **Security** - Scope adds security to our code by ensuring that variables can

   only be accessed by pre-defined parts of our programs.

2. **Reduced Variable Name Collisions** - Scope reduces variable name

   collisions, also known as namespace collisions, by ensuring you can use the

   same variable name multiple times in different scopes without accidentally

   overwriting those variable's values.

### Different kinds of scope

There are three types of scope in JavaScript: `global scope`, `local scope`, and `block scope`.

#### Global scope

Let's start by talking about the widest scope there is: _global scope_. The _global scope_ is represented by the `window` object in the browser and the `global` object in Node.js. Adding attributes to these objects makes them available throughout the entire program. We can show this with a quick example:

```javascript
let myName = "Apples";

console.log(myName);
// this myName references the myName variable from this scope,
// so myName will evaluate to "Apples"
```

The variable `myName` above is not inside a function, it is just lying out in the open in our code. The `myName` variable is part of _global scope_. The Global scope is the largest scope that exists, it is the outermost scope that exists.

While useful on occasion, global variables are best avoided. Every time a variable is declared on the global scope, the chance of a name collision increases. If we are unaware of the global variables in our code, we may accidentally overwrite variables.

#### Local scope

The **scope** of a function is the set of variables that are available for use within that function. We call the scope within a function: _local scope_. The _local scope_ of a function includes:

1. the function's arguments
2. any local variables declared inside the function
3. **any variables that were already declared when the function was defined**

In JavaScript when we enter a new function we enter a **new scope**:

```javascript
// global scope
let myName = "global";

function function1() {
  // function1's scope
  let myName = "func1";
  console.log("function1 myName: " + myName);
}

function function2() {
  // function2's scope
  let myName = "func2";
  console.log("function2 myName: " + myName);
}

function1(); // function1 myName: func1
function2(); // function2 myName: func2
console.log("global myName: " + myName); // global myName: global
```

In the code above we are dealing with three different scopes: the global scope, `function1`, and `function2`. Since each of the `myName` variables were declared in separate scopes, we _are_ allowed to reuse variable names without any issues. This is because each of the `myName` variables is bound to their respective functions.

#### Block scope

A block in JavaScript is denoted by a pair of curly braces \(`{}`\). Examples of block statements in JavaScript are `if` conditionals or `for` and `while` loops.

When using the keywords `let` or `const` the variables defined within the curly braces will be _block scoped_. Let's look at an example:

```javascript
// global scope
let dog = "woof";

// block scope
if (true) {
  let dog = "bowwow";
  console.log(dog); // will print "bowwow"
}

console.log(dog); // will print "woof"
```

#### Scope chaining: variables and scope

A key scoping rule in JavaScript is the fact that **an** _**inner**_ **scope does have access to variables in the** _**outer**_ **scope**.

Let's look at a simple example:

```javascript
let name = "Fiona";

// we aren't passing in or defining and variables
function hungryHippo() {
  console.log(name + " is hungry!");
}

hungryHippo(); // => "Fiona is hungry"
```

So when the `hungryHippo` function is declared a new local scope will be created for that function. Continuing on that line of thought what happens when we refer to `name` inside of `hungryHippo`? If the `name` variable is not found in the immediate scope, JavaScript will search all of the accessible outer scopes until it finds a variable name that matches the one we are referencing. Once it finds the first matching variable, it will stop searching. In JavaScript this is called _scope chaining_.

Now let's look at an example of scope chaining with nested scope. Just like functions in JavaScript, a scope can be nested within another scope. Take a look at the example below:

```javascript
// global scope
let person = "Rae";

// sayHello function's local scope
function sayHello() {
  let person = "Jeff";

  // greet function's local scope
  function greet() {
    console.log("Hi, " + person + "!");
  }
  greet();
}

sayHello(); // logs 'Hi, Jeff!'
```

In the example above, the variable `person` is referenced by `greet`, even though it was never declared within `greet`! When this code is executed JavaScript will attempt to run the `greet` function - notice there is no `person` variable within the scope of the `greet` function and move on to seeing if that variable is defined in an outer scope.

Notice that the `greet` function prints out `Hi, Jeff!` instead of `Hi, Rae!`. This is because JavaScript will start at the inner most scope looking for a variable named `person`. Then JavaScript will work it's way outward looking for a variable with a matching name of `person`. Since the `person` variable within `sayHello` is in the next level of scope above `greet` JavaScript then stops it's scope chaining search and assigns the value of the `person` variable.

Functions such as `greet` that use \(ie. **capture**\) variables like the person variable are called **closures**. We'll be talking a lot more about closures very soon!

**Important** An inner scope can reference outer variables, but an outer scope cannot reference inner variables:

```javascript
function potatoMaker() {
  let name = "potato";
  console.log(name);
}

potatoMaker(); // => "potato"

console.log(name); // => ReferenceError: name is not defined
```

#### Lexical scope

There is one last important concept to talk about when we refer to scope - and that is _lexical scope_. Whenever you run a piece of JavaScript that code is first parsed before it is actually run. This is known as the _lexing time_. In the _lexing time_ your parser resolves variable names to their values when functions are nested.

The main take away is that _lexical scope_ is determined at _lexing time_ so we can determine the values of variables without having to run any code. JavaScript is a language **without dynamic** scoping. This means that by looking at a piece of code we can determine the values of variables just by looking at the different scopes involved.

Let's look at a quick example:

```javascript
function outer() {
  let x = 5;

  function inner() {
    // here we know the value of x because scope chaining will
    // go into the scope above this one looking for variable named x.
    // We do not need to run this code in order to determine the value of x!
    console.log(x);
  }
  inner();
}
```

In the `inner` function above we don't need to run the `outer` function to know what the value of `x` will be because of _lexical scoping_.

The **scope** of a program in JavaScript is the set of variables that are available for use within the program. Due to _lexical scoping_ we can determine the value of a variable by looking at various scopes without having to run our code. _Scope Chaining_ allows code within an _inner_ scope to access variables declared in an _outer_ scope.

There are three different scopes:

* _global scope_ - the global space is JavaScript
* _local scope_ - created when a function is defined
* _block scope_ - created by entering a pair of curly braces
