### Installing Git Completion
Git completion is an autocomplete tool for git branches and commands.  This step is optional, though you will have to delete the Git completion line from your bashrc file if you decide skip this section. To install Git completion run

```
git_url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/contrib/completion"
curl "$git_url/git-completion.bash" > "$HOME/.git-completion.bash"
curl "$git_url/git-prompt.sh" > "$HOME/.git-prompt.sh"

### Uninstall RVM
RVM is a ruby version manager, but since we will be using rbenv, we can uninstall RVM. Run command

```
which rvm
```

If no directory for RVM is displayed, then you are done.  If RVM's location is displayed then RVM is installed. To uninstall run

```
rvm implode
```

### Installing Ruby

Run

```
eval "$(rbenv init -)"
rbenv global
```

If the version is 2.5.0 then you have the correct version.  If the version is incorrect, run

rbenv install 2.5.0
rbenv global 2.5.0
rbenv rehash
```

### Installing Ruby Libraries

```
git clone https://github.com/creationix/nvm.git $NVM_DIR
cd $NVM_DIR
git checkout `git describe --abbrev=0 --tag`  
```

Notice that the git command uses backticks and not quotes
