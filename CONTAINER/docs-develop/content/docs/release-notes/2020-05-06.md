### Single Sends API update

The Marketing Campaigns Single Sends API has been updated to simplify the steps to create, schedule, and send Single Sends via the API. Users no longer need to create a template first. To create and save a new Single Send, all that is required is a name. For complete details, please see our [overview page]({{root_url}}/for-developers/sending-email/single-sends-2020-update/) and the [API reference documentation](https://sendgrid.api-docs.io/v3.0/single-sends/create-single-send).
