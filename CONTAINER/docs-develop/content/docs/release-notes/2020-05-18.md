### Signed Event Webhook Requests and OAuth for Event Webhook in Public Beta

Twilio SendGrid now provides two security features that allow you to verify that email event data is being posted by Twilio SendGrid: a Signed Event Webhook and OAuth 2.0. These security features are independent of one another and can be used together.

Twilio SendGridâ€™s Signed Event Webhook uses the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm to sign requests. The signature allows customers to verify that event data is being posted by Twilio SendGrid.

OAuth 2.0 for the Twilio SendGrid Event Webhook allows customers to verify that Twilio SendGrid is properly authorized by them to post to their URLs using the Client Credentials grant type.

To learn more about these new features in Beta, visit [our documentation]({{root_url}}/for-developers/tracking-events/getting-started-event-webhook-security-features/).

### New image editing options

The email editors within Marketing Campaigns now support more options for formatting your images. You can crop, flip and rotate your images, add filters, or make adjustments like contrast or opacity all from within your email editing workflow. These editing options are also available within the Design Library under Your Images. [Learn more]({{root_url}}/ui/sending-email/image-editor/).
