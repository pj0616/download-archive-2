## Manually Select the Winner of an A/B Test

You can now manually select the winner of an A/B test for a Single Send. The ability to manually select a test winner allows you to make more nuanced decisions about how to best engage your audience and prioritize the metrics that are most important to you, such as unsubscribes, spam reports, or conversions. To learn more about A/B testing, see [A/B Testing Your Single Send]({{root_url}}/ui/sending-email/a-b-testing/).
