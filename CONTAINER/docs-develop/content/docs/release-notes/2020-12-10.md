## Signup Form Field Enhancement

You can now add any [reserved field]({{root_url}}/ui/managing-contacts/custom-fields/#reserved-fields) or [custom fields]({{root_url}}/ui/managing-contacts/custom-fields/) to a signup form. This means marketers can capture more of the data that they rely on when contacts sign up via a signup form. The collected data will then flow directly into Contacts within Marketing Campaigns.

## Bulk Delete Automations

You can now bulk delete Automations using the multi-select tool from the Automation homepage.

To select one or more Automations to delete, click the checkbox to the left of the Automation. Next, open the **Selected** dropdown and then click **Delete**.
