## New Get Contacts by Email API Endpoint

The new Get Contacts by Email endpoint allows you to retrieve one or more contacts by their email or alternate email addresses. This endpoint should be used when you know the email(s) you are searching for. If you need access to a larger set of contacts, please continue to use the export contacts functionality.
