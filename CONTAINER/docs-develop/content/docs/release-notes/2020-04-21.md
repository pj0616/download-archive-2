### Clearer test sends

Marketing Campaigns supports sending a test email to up to 10 email addresses at a time. Now, when users send a test email, Marketing Campaigns automatically adds “Test -” to the beginning of the subject line. This ensures test recipients know the email is a test and was not yet actually sent to the targeted list or segment.
