### Duplicate a segment

You can now create new segments by copying an existing segment and making minor modifications. The ability to duplicate a segment means you no longer have to start from scratch when creating new segments. For more information about creating segments, see [Segmenting your Contacts]({{root_url}}/ui/managing-contacts/segmenting-your-contacts/).
