## Signup Form Error Handling Enhancements

Signup forms will now display more elegant and helpful error messages when a user attempts to submit an invalid email address, leaves a required field blank, or fails to complete a CAPTCHA. Clear indications of where the error occurred in the form and legibility enhancements help users more quickly identify and fix form errors.

## Import Contacts via Compressed CSV Files

You can now import up to 1 million contacts or 5GB of data, whichever is less, using compressed CSV files via the [Contacts API](https://sendgrid.api-docs.io/v3.0/contacts/import-contacts). The import endpoint also supports gzipped CSV files.
