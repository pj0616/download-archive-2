## New column layouts available for the Marketing Campaigns Design Editor

The Marketing Campaigns Design Editor now supports four new column layouts. In addition to evenly proportioned columns, you can now create layouts with ratios of 1:2, 2:1, 1:3, and 3:1. As with prior layouts, each column contains multiple drop zones where you can add non-column modules such as buttons, text, and images.
