## Account Setup Requirements

In order to enhance security for all of our users, we have added a few required steps before new users are able to upgrade to a paid Twilio SendGrid plan. These steps are required to verify your identity, secure access to your account, while also authenticating your reputation ownership; setting you up for future email delivery success.

For more information on these requirements, visit [Verifying Your Account]({{root_url}}/ui/account-and-settings/verifying-your-account/) in the docs.
