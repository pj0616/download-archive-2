## Support for "View in Browser" Links

You can now include a “view in browser” link in your Marketing Campaigns emails using the Weblink Substitution Tag.

The "view in browser" link points to an online version of your email, which will display your HTML as designed, protecting against potential email client rendering issues. This ensures recipients have a fallback to view your email, and provides them an option to share the email with friends using the link in addition to forwarding the email.
