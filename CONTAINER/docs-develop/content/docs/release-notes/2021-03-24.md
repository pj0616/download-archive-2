## API Key and 2FA Requirements Enforced for Paid Users

In order to enhance security for all of our users, Twilio SendGrid now requires customers on all paid plans to use API Key authentication on all API requests and SMTP configurations. Customers must also enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for all users, including teammates. Visit our docs for more information on [Upgrading to API Keys]({{root_url}}/for-developers/sending-email/upgrade-your-authentication-method-to-api-keys/) and [Enabling Two-Factor Authentication]({{root_url}}/ui/account-and-settings/two-factor-authentication/). If you did not receive notifications about this change please [update your account email address]({{root_url}}/ui/account-and-settings/account/).
