### Specify multiple From addresses in personalizations

Twilio SendGrid now allows you to define multiple From addresses in personalizations objects. This allows you to override the default sender in each personalization as long as the default sending domain and personalizations sending domains match. For more information, visit our [Personalizations documentation]({{root_url}}/for-developers/sending-email/personalizations/#sending-multiple-emails-from-multiple-senders-to-multiple-recipients).
