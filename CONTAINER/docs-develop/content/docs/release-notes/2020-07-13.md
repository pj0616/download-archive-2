### Signed Event Webhook Requests and OAuth for Event Webhook Generally Available

Twilio SendGrid now provides two security features that allow you to verify that email event data is being posted by Twilio SendGrid: a Signed Event Webhook and OAuth 2.0. These security features are independent of one another and can be used together.

Twilio SendGridâ€™s Signed Event Webhook uses the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm to sign requests. The signature allows customers to verify that event data is being posted by Twilio SendGrid.

OAuth 2.0 for the Twilio SendGrid Event Webhook allows customers to verify that Twilio SendGrid is properly authorized by them to post to their URLs using the Client Credentials grant type.
