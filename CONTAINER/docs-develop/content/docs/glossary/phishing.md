Phishing is a technique for acquiring information such as user names, passwords, credit cards, social security numbers or other personal data by masquerading as a trusted entity like a bank or credit card company. Phishing emails appear to be sent by the trusted entity, which can cause the consumer to be tricked into providing their personal information.

SendGrid employs both technology and staff to prevent the sending of phishing emails. We have a solid track record of working with the global email community to detect and stop the sending of phishing and spam emails.

## Reporting Email Abuse

SendGrid works hard to keep our email stream clean. Despite our best efforts, spam does occasionally leak through our defenses. If you discover spam that was sent by a SendGrid customer, please report it to our team by sending it to abuse@sendgrid.com or opening a ticket with [SendGrid Support](https://support.sendgrid.com/hc/en-us). No matter who sent the phishing email, you can file a report with the [Federal Trade Commission](http://www.ftc.gov/complaint).

If we find that a SendGrid customer is sending spoofed or phishing emails, we will ban their account immediately
