A Single Send is a one-time nonautomated email message delivered to a list or segment of your audience. A Single Send may be sent immediately or scheduled for future delivery. Unlike an [automated email]({{root_url}}/glossary/automated-email/) series such as a [drip campaign]({{root_url}}/glossary/drip-campaign/), a Single Send is not part of a series of related messages that are designed to work in sequence.

Single Sends can serve many use cases, including promotional offers, engagement campaigns, newsletters, announcements, legal notices, or policy updates. This means Single Sends are appropriate for both [transactional email]({{root_url}}/glossary/transactional-email/) and [promotional messages]({{root_url}}/glossary/email-marketing/).
