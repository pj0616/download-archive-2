We recommend using Twilio SendGrid PHP, our client library, [available on GitHub](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-php), with full documentation.

Do you have an [API Key](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys) yet? If not, go get one. You're going to need it to integrate!

Make sure you've set the [SENDGRID_API_KEY](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-php#setup-environment-variables) environment variable in your env file.

</call-out>

## Using Twilio SendGrid's PHP Library

Please see the [Twilio SendGrid PHP example code at GitHub](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-php/blob/main/USE_CASES.md#send-an-email-to-a-single-recipient).
