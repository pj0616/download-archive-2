Whether you’re a startup or a large enterprise, SendGrid has several plans tailored to meet your email needs.

## Upgrade your SendGrid plan

Before you can upgrade account, you need to complete some verification steps for security purposes.

<call-out type="warning">

If you signed up for a Twilio SendGrid account prior to 9/17/2020, skip to the [choose a plan](#choose-a-plan) section of this page.

</call-out>

_To unlock your Twilio SendGrid account:_

1. Confirm your email address. If you need to resend the verification email, click **Resend account verification**. If you entered your email address incorrectly in the initial signup form, you can correct the email address and resend the verification email to the correct address.
1. Set up [Domain Authentication]({{root_url}}/ui/account-and-settings/how-to-set-up-domain-authentication/).
   Authenticating your domain shows email providers that Twilio SendGrid has your permission to send emails on your behalf.

If you don't have access to your domain's DNS records, you can use the **Send To A Coworker** feature. This feature allows you to enter a colleague's email address so Twilio SendGrid can send them all the information they need to complete domain authentication on your behalf.

3. Set up [Two-Factor Authentication]({{root_url}}/ui/account-and-settings/two-factor-authentication/)

4. Add a [payment method]({{root_url}}/ui/account-and-settings/billing/#payment-methods). Your card will not be charged at this time.
