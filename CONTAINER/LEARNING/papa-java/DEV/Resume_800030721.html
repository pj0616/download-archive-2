                    <p>Designed and fully implemented a REST backend service to mitigate the Segregation of Responsibilities (SOR) concern as a Java Spring-boot server application.</p><p>As people move around various departments within the company, they may acquire privileges whose combinations may be considered toxic. The SOR checks applicable rules to detect violations upon request (in preventive mode) and flags existing violators (in detective mode).</p><p>Implemented functionality to detect and prevent violations of privileges (what users can do within applications) and responsibilities (what user may do with deployments, i.e. deploy to production).</p><p>Designed and implemented a novel approach of supporting bi-temporality within Spring boot JPA applications.</p><p>Designed and implemented a brand new feature to SOR to support Eligibility rules, in addition to existing Segregation rules.</p><p>Implemented overrides to SOR, to allow temporary access to a select group of employees, after multi-level approvals have been granted.</p><p>Provided materials to both internal and PWC auditors to pass reviews.</p><p>Led team of four developers by assigning tasks, conducting scrum calls, coaching, providing training materials, and reviewing merge requests.</p><p>Introduced a Git branch naming convention, for use by members of our team, and ensured its proper adherence.</p><p>Created 'new joiner' Confluence pages that were utilized by all members of the Tech Risk department, as well as many other personnel within the firm.</p><p>Managed project lifecycle by re-organizing Jira epics and stories, and instituting two-week sprints.</p><p><br/></p>
