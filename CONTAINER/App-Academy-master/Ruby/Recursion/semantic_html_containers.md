# Semantic HTML Containers
There are many ways to structure and style a page to achieve the same design, but by maintaining this box perspective we will minimize our efforts.

## Containers
HTML elements that are purely used to hold other HTML elements are commonly called containers.

## Semantic HTML
Tags used to dfine container elements:

`<header>TOp header section of a page</header>`
`<footer>Container for elements in the footer section of a page</footer>`
`<nav>Hold nav elements</nav>`
`<article>Hold content that makes sense on its own like posts or comments</article>`
`<aside>Hold sidebar sections that are tangentially related to the content</aside>`
`<figure>Holds images, graphic content, code samples, etc</figure>`
`<figcaption>Holds caption content for a corresponding figure element</figcaption>`
`<section>Section of the page or chapter of an <article> with a heading</section>`
`<div>Common container element used when other semantic elements aren't appropriate</div>`
