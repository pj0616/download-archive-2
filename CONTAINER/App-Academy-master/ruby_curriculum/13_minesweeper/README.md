# Minesweeper 

Command line version of the classic Minesweeper. 

~~To-do: Figure out how to reveal the number of adjacent bombs to neighbors of a selected tile. Been receiving a stack flood error in recursive method.~~ UPDATE: Implemented working iterative solution. ~~Next is to implement win/lose logic.. then probably refactor and clean-up messy methods.~~

Game is now 99% (Yes, exactly that :]) complete. I'm sure there are bugs that I'll dig through later when I want to play Minesweeper.. or someone bothers me to implement fix! Fun project.
