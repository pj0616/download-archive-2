# Weather Fetcher

This responsive application, built using Object-Oriented Programming principles, uses JavaScript's built in fetch API & modern async/await syntax to make AJAX requests and retrieve JSON format weather data from [OpenWeatherMap public API](https://openweathermap.org/api). 

## How It Works

* User inputs city name and country code (e.g. San Diego, US) 
* User selects the units of measurement they'd like to be displayed 
* Temperature, brief weather description, wind speed and relative humidity are displayed. 

## Technologies + Tools 

* Bootstrap 4/Bootswatch
* OpenWeatherMap API
* HTML5
* CSS3
* AJAX
* JavaScript
