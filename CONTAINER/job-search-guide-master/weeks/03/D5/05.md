## Today's Learning Goals:

- What is the time complexity of Bubble Sort? What are the steps for this algorithm?
- Describe when it may be ideal to utilize Bubble Sort
- What are the issues one may face when scaling horizontally?
- What is Vertical Scaling?
- What does the `length` attribute refer to on a Function in Javascript?
- Where in a SQL query may we use a sub query (After which SQL keyword) ?

## Study

### Algorithms

Review one of the first sorting algorithms we learning (way back in Alpha Course!) in App Academy. The second article discusses a very clever use case for bubble sort, which many dismiss as a useless algorithm.

### Web

Today's Web readings start to get into the topic of System Design. System Design is a topic asked in more advanced Engineer interviews, and is really cool when you start to get a grasp on it. These scalability readings are an awesome introduction to how to grow a system efficiently!
