## Today's Learning Goals:

- [x] Explain Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm. What algorithm does this remind you of? What's the difference?
- [x] Explain floats and clears
- [x] Explain the clearfix
- [x] What is a Trie?
- [x] What might you want to store in each node in your Trie?
- [x] How do you handle it when your Trie becomes too large to be stored on one machine?
- [x] How would you collect and update the top results for a certain node in the Trie?
