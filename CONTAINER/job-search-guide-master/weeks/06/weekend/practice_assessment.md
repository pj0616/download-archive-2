# ðŸš¨ Practice Test ðŸš¨ 

Welcome to the end of Week 6! The next step is to double down on what you've learned, and prepare for the HackerRank test that will be in the following task. The first step is to work through this practice test to have an idea of what to expect on the HackerRank exam.

Before you dive into the HackerRank test, it's important to review. We use the HackerRank test results to gauge your progress in the job search guide, so you'll want to make sure you are as prepared as possible. If you struggle on this practice exam, be sure to review flash cards!

Make an honest effort with these problems. An answer key is at the bottom of the page, but try and review your notes and readings before referring to these. 


1. 1.) Select the correct statement(s) about Partials and Currying
  * A) Partial functions allow you make general functions more specific by fixing certain arguments
  * B) Curried functions only take one argument at a time
  * C) Curried functions return functions
  * D) The first argument to a curried function must be how many arguments it will eventually accepts
  * E) Curried functions leverage closures to accumulate data

1. 2.) Choose the correct statement(s) about algorithms
  * A) Detecting a cycle in a graph with the Union-Find method uses an extra data structure to track parent child relationships
  * B) The Union-Find method requires iterating through all the edges of a graph
  * C) In the Boggle problem, you initiate only one DFS starting with a random letter and eventually all the words will be found
  * D) The Boggle problem requires a record of visited squares
  * E) In the Boggle problem, when you find a word you return true immediately so that the word can bubble back up
  * F) The Floyd-Warshall algorithm for finding the shortest path builds up a matrix of costs between each and every node, even if two nodes don't share an edge
1. 3.) Which statement(s) is/are correct about Rails Services
  * A) Services are a built in Module-type in Rails
  * B) Services are used to make models and controllers light-weight
  * C) Services can be used to model interactions between two different objects
  * D) Services refer to gems provided by third party companies to do things like process credit card transactions
  * E) Services don't have access to Rails callback/lifecycle methods
1. 4.) Choose the correct statement(s) about Flexbox
  * A) `flex: 1` will make all elements contained in that div have the same width
  * B) The `align-items` property has a default value that makes all elements in that div have the same height
  * C) `flex-basis` is used to set the proportional width of a div
  * D) The shorthand syntax for flex specifies `flex-grow`, `flex-direction`, and `flex-wrap`
  * E) `margin: auto` can be used to center the content of a flexed element
1. 5.) Choose the correct statements(s) relating to the TinyURL design question
  * A) Generating a random string and storing it in the database is a sufficient solution as long as your application only accepts one incoming connection at a time
  * B) a seven-character string might have two different byte representations
  * C) Using a MD5 hashing algorithm to create tinyURLs of 7 base-62 characters is safe from hash collisions
  * D) Using a counter-increment to deliver the next tinyURL is fine if you only have one server
  * E) Using a range-based counter to split up the domain of tinyURLs across multiple servers requires the servers to talk to each other directly so that they know who has what range
1. 6.) Choose the correct statement(s) about the Display and Position, Floats/Clears properties
  * A) blocks will try to take up as much space as possible
  * B) Inline elements do not accept the height and width property
  * C) Setting position to Absolute leaves space in the document flow, but you can set the position with coordinates relative to the document.
  * D) Floated elements will cause other elements to wrap around them
  * E) Clears undo the float property when applied to child elements
  * F) The 'Clearfix' uses pseudo selectors and hidden elements
1. 7.) Choose the correct statement(s) about Minimum Spanning Trees
  * A) A minimum spanning tree can have a cycle as long as it in between the first and last node in the graph
  * B) In Prims algorithm, each node is assigned a value corresponding to the least cost edge seen so far that leads to that node.
  * C) The difference between Dijkstra's algorithm and Prims algorithm is that the MST from Prims will always contain the shortest path between any two nodes, but not vice-versa
  * D) In Kruskals algorithm, the graph is processed with Union-Find first and then sorted by edge cost
  * E) There is only one minimum spanning tree for every graph
  * F) A graph must be acyclic to have a minimum spanning tree
1. 8.) Choose the correct statement(s) about Designing Autocomplete or a Messaging service
  * A) A Trie is a type of BST
  * B) Since Tries cannot store arbitrary amounts of data in a given node, you must use a hashmap to store the top phrases for a given node in the Trie
  * C) When setting up messaging between two users, the server will instruct the two users how to set up a websocket between them
  * D) Messages that are sent to offline users should be stored in the memory of the server that the message was sent to
  * E) Websockets are initilaized using the HTTP protocol
  * F) Websockets use framing to ensure accurate receipt of messages
