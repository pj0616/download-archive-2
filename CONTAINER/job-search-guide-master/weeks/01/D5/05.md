## Today's Learning Goals:

- [x] Give an example of a use-case for Topological Sort 
- [x] What is a difference between Topological Sort and DFS?
- [x] On which types of Graphs can we do a topological sort?
- [x] What data structure do we use to assist with the topological sort algorithm?
- [x] Explain TCP, and why it is a necessary protocol
- [x] When is using an IIFE necessary? 
- [x] What is the syntax for an IIFE?
- [x] Give one explanation for why we have to make AJAX requests in `componentDidMount`

## Study

### Algorithms
* [Topological Sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddTC4Zovtbc)
* [Top sort reading and code](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/topological-sorting/)

### Web

Watch two Spotify Engineers break down how information is broken down into **packets** over the internet. Learn about what these packets are, how **T**ransmission **C**ontrol **P**rotocal assists in their delivery!

Watch: 
* [Packets, routers, and reliability (6 mins)](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/internet-intro/internet-works-intro/v/the-internet-packet-routers-and-reliability) (There is also a Transcript on this page)
* [TCP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpsEaqJV_A0)

### JavaScript

One of the more advanced techniques in Javascript, **I**mmediately **I**nvoked **F**unction **E**xpressions are extremely helpful in certain use-cases. If you learn how to use them correctly, you'll be writing in JS like a true pro.

### Misc

* [React lifecycle methods](https://engineering.musefind.com/react-lifecycle-methods-how-and-when-to-use-them-2111a1b692b1)

### Make Flashcards

* Explain the steps of topological sort.
* What is TCP? When is it used? How does it work?
* What's an IFFE? When would you use it?
* What lifecycle methods get called in the update phase? What are the use cases for each of those methods? What method gets called in the unmounting phase?

## Practice

* Review Anki.

## Code

Here are some suggestions on what you could be working on:

1. **Polishing or adding features to existing projects**- First prioritize polishing and adding features to existing projects.
1. **New projects**- Once your existing projects are in great shape, start building out new projects. Start with smaller-scale projects, and over time, add more fatures to them. (**Unfinished projects are not a bad thing, as long as you are learning from them!**)
1. **Coding Challenges**- All throughout, be sure to put in a sufficient amount of time to coding challenges; always go above and beyond, especially for companies that you really want to work at.
