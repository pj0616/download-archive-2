## Today's Learning Goals:

- [x] Give a high level overview of an Adjacency Matrix
- [x] If we were only concerned about time complexity, is an Adjacency Matrix efficient? Why/why not? 
- [x] If we were only concerned about space complexity, is an Adjacency Matrix efficient? Why/why not?
- [x] Give a high level overview of an Adjacency List
- [x] What benefits do we get from an Adjacency List?
- [x] What are the benefits of a Javascript closure?
- [x] Formally define a Javascript closure
- [x] Give an example of a closure
- [x] What is **data encapsulation**?

## Study

### Web

If you didn't finish yesterday's reading on REST, take this time to finish and review the learning goals.

* [REST](https://codewords.recurse.com/issues/five/what-restful-actually-means)

### JavaScript

Read:
* [Closures (search for the Closures section)](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-definitive-javascript-handbook-for-a-developer-interview-44ffc6aeb54e)

### Misc

### Make Flashcards

* **UPDATE EXISTING CARD** Explain the different ways that graphs can be represented. What are the pros and cons of various ways of representing graphs.
* **UPDATE EXISTING CARD** What does it mean to be RESTful?
* What's a closure? How are they used?
* Give a high level overview of how CSS grids work.

## Practice

* Review Anki.

## Code

Here are some suggestions on what you could be working on:

1. **Polishing or adding features to existing projects**- First prioritize polishing and adding features to existing projects.
1. **New projects**- Once your existing projects are in great shape, start building out new projects. Start with smaller-scale projects, and over time, add more fatures to them. (**Unfinished projects are not a bad thing, as long as you are learning from them!**)
1. **Coding Challenges**- All throughout, be sure to put in a sufficient amount of time to coding challenges; always go above and beyond, especially for companies that you really want to work at.
