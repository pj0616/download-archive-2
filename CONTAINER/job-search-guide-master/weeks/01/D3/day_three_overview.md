## Today's Learning Goals:

- What are the steps for DFS on a graph? 
- What supporting data structure might you use for BFS and DFS, respectively?
- What happens when you type in www.google.com and hit enter?
- What is the difference between the memory heap and call stack in javascript?
- What is one problem with programming languages that are fully single-threaded?

## Practice

**The learning goals are designed so that they can be used as Flash Card questions. Practice for at least 30 minutes today.**

### Besides Reviewing your flash cards it is also important to keep your algorithm and whiteboarding skills sharp. 
* Do 1 Leetcode or Hackerrank Problem
* Do 1 whiteboarding problem

## Code Everyday!

Here are some suggestions on what you could be working on:

* **Polishing or adding features to existing projects**- First prioritize polishing and adding features to existing projects.
* **New projects**- Once your existing projects are in great shape, start building out new projects. Start with smaller-scale projects, and over time, add more features to them. (**Unfinished projects are not a bad thing, as long as you are learning from them!**)
* **Coding Challenges**- All throughout, be sure to put in a sufficient amount of time to coding challenges; always go above and beyond, especially for companies that you really want to work at.
