## Today's Learning Goals:

- [x] What are the steps for BFS on a graph? 
- [x] Why do we need a DNS?
- [x] Is Javascript a single-threaded language? Explain (Hint: This may not be a yes or no question)
- [x] In which order do the React Lifecycle methods (including the optional ones) run?
- [x] In which lyfecycle methods should you make asynchronous fetches for data?
- [x] In which lyfecycle methods can you call `setState`?


## Study

### Algorithms

* [BFS reading and code](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/breadth-first-traversal-for-a-graph/)

### Web

In yesterday's readings, you may have noticed the term **DNS** mentioned in the context of our browser requests. A **D**omain **N**ame **S**ystem is one of the key components to how requests are made from your browser. Today's Web reading will break down how they work, and begin to build your fundamental understanding of how we browse the web.

### JavaScript

Continue to watch and read about the event loop. It's ok if you didn't understand it right away -- watch until it clicks!

### Misc

React lifecycle
* [React lifecycle methods](https://engineering.musefind.com/react-lifecycle-methods-how-and-when-to-use-them-2111a1b692b1)

### Make Flashcards

* What are the steps for BFS on a graph?
* How does DNS work?
* **UPDATE EXISTING CARD** What's the event loop? How does it work?
* What lifecycle methods get called in the mounting phase? What are the use cases for each of those methods?

## Practice

* Review Anki.

## Code

Here are some suggestions on what you could be working on:

1. **Polishing or adding features to existing projects**- First prioritize polishing and adding features to existing projects.
1. **New projects**- Once your existing projects are in great shape, start building out new projects. Start with smaller-scale projects, and over time, add more fatures to them. (**Unfinished projects are not a bad thing, as long as you are learning from them!**)
1. **Coding Challenges**- All throughout, be sure to put in a sufficient amount of time to coding challenges; always go above and beyond, especially for companies that you really want to work at.
