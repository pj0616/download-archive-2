## Today's Learning Goals:

- What are the steps for BFS on a graph? 
- Why do we need a DNS?
* How does DNS work?
- Is Javascript a single-threaded language? Explain (Hint: This may not be a yes or no question)
- In which order do the React Lifecycle methods (including the optional ones) run?
- In which lyfecycle methods should you make asynchronous fetches for data?
- In which lyfecycle methods can you call `setState`?
- What lifecycle methods get called in the mounting phase? What are the use cases for each of those methods?

## Practice

* **UPDATE EXISTING CARD** What's the event loop? How does it work?

**The learning goals are designed so that they can be used as Flash Card questions. Practice for at least 30 minutes today.**


### Besides Reviewing your flash cards it is also important to keep your algorithm and whiteboarding skills sharp. 
* Do 1 Leetcode or Hackerrank Problem
* Do 1 whiteboarding problem

## Code Everyday!

Here are some suggestions on what you could be working on:

* **Polishing or adding features to existing projects**- First prioritize polishing and adding features to existing projects.
* **New projects**- Once your existing projects are in great shape, start building out new projects. Start with smaller-scale projects, and over time, add more features to them. (**Unfinished projects are not a bad thing, as long as you are learning from them!**)
* **Coding Challenges**- All throughout, be sure to put in a sufficient amount of time to coding challenges; always go above and beyond, especially for companies that you really want to work at.
