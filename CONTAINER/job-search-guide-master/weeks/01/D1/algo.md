## Algorithms

Graphs are a critical data structure in the programming industry. Today's videos are an introduction. Respectively, they cover:

* How do we define a graph, and where are they commonly used?
* What are the specific attributes that graphs can have, and how do we talk about them?
* What are some ways we might store a graph in memory? What space/time complexity problems might we face?
