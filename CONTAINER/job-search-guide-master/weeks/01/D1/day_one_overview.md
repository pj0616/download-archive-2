## Today's Learning Goals:

- How do we define a graph mathematically?
- What is the difference between directed, undirected, weighted, and unweighted?
- Give an example of various types of graphs (Weighted Undirected, Unweighted Directed, Unweighted Undirected, etc.)
- What makes a graph a simple graph? What attributes would make it not simple?
- What is the maximum number of edges in a directed simple graph? Undirected simple graph? Answer should be in terms of `N`
- Describe the levels of connectivity a graph can have (strongly connected, weakly connected).
- What are cycles?
- What are some naive ways we can store and traverse graphs? Be able to discuss time/space complexity of these approaches, and what issues we may face.  
- What are the three **primary** Fielding constraints? (Bonus if you can say who Fielding is!)
- What sub-constraints make up a **Uniform Interface**
- Walk through an arbitrary example of a RESTful request/response cycle, and describe _**what**_ makes it RESTful
- Give a high level overview of what an object's prototype represents
- What are the differences between the `__proto__` and `prototype` attributes?
- What happens when we **do** or **don't** explicity set an object's prototype?
- What is an object's **default** prototype?
- What are the valid values for an object's prototype?
- Name 5 benefits of HTML5
- What is `localStorage`? How might you use it?
- Why are media queries useful?
- What is mobile-first design? Be as specific as possible.

## Practice

**The learning goals are designed so that they can be used as Flash Card questions. If you haven't already, make these learning goals into Flash Cards. Practice for at least 30 minutes today.**

### Besides Reviewing your flash cards it is also important to keep your algorithm and whiteboarding skills sharp. 
* Do 1 Leetcode or Hackerrank Problem
* Do 1 whiteboarding problem

## Code Everyday!

Here are some suggestions on what you could be working on:

* **Polishing or adding features to existing projects**- First prioritize polishing and adding features to existing projects.
* **New projects**- Once your existing projects are in great shape, start building out new projects. Start with smaller-scale projects, and over time, add more features to them. (**Unfinished projects are not a bad thing, as long as you are learning from them!**)
* **Coding Challenges**- All throughout, be sure to put in a sufficient amount of time to coding challenges; always go above and beyond, especially for companies that you really want to work at.
