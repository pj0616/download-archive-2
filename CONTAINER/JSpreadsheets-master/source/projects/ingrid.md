description: Ingrid, the jquery Datagrid.
---

Datagrids don't have to be difficult to use anymore - say hi to Ingrid. Ingrid is an unobtrusive jQuery component that adds datagrid behaviors like column resizing, paging, sorting, row and column styling (and more) to your tables.

Ingrid's got 3 main parts: a header, a body, and a paging control. 
The header is a table with `<th>`'s as columns; the body is a table nested in a scrollable div; the paging control is a plain old div with links styled as buttons.
