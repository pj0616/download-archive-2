description: Spreadsheet as a ReactJS component.
---

The goal of this project is to build an online spreadsheet. It is a 40x40 grid with editable cells. Cells adapt to the data entered by the user.

When clicking a cell, the background of the cell turns blue, indicating it has been selected. Double click turns the background orange, indicating it can be edited.

Cell editing allows the user to enter numeric values or strings, as well as formulas.
