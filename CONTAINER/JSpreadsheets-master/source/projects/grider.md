---

Grider is a plugin for jQuery that makes your life easier when you need to edit or create
a table that handles a list of items. It helps you to do calculations in a very simple
way, it has the following features:

* Can make simple operations defined in the headers
* Can add a row count to the table
* Adds or deletes rows based on a row
* Has summaries for average (avg), sum (sum), maximum (max) and minimum (min)
* Works nice with Ruby on rails [nested forms](http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2009/1/26/nested-model-forms)
