ParamQuery grid is open source jQuery grid plugin for displaying and manipulating tabular data in rich Ajax applications.Inspired by MS Excel and Google spreadsheet, it leaves no stone unturned when it comes to performance. It surpasses the benchmarks hitherto set by well known commercial and open source grids for gracefully handling largest number of records.
