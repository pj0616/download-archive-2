To add a new library to our leaderboard, **[fork the GitHub repo](https://github.com/krzysztofspilka/JSpreadsheets)** then add a new file to the **[source/projects](https://github.com/krzysztofspilka/JSpreadsheets/tree/master/source/projects)** directory and make a pull request. We accept most requests as long as they stay relevant and have any sign of community activity (forks, stars, issues etc.).

To facilitate the reviewing process, please follow the schema (**[see example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/krzysztofspilka/JSpreadsheets/master/source/projects/handsontable.md)**).
